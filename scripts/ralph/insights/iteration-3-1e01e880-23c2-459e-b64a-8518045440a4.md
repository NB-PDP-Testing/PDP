## Patterns Discovered
- I see the pattern now. The child-card.tsx uses `passportData?.skills` which is a `Record<string, number>`. Let me look at the actual return structure from the backend query to understand what's being returned.
- The linter removed my import! Good news is TypeScript is happy. The biome warnings about `any` are acceptable - I see the same pattern in coach-feedback.tsx. Let me re-add the import and the usage together. First let me check if the import got removed from page.tsx:

- Good - no type errors in my new component or page.tsx! The errors shown are pre-existing ones in other files (same `any` warnings). Now let me commit US-009:
