  "description": "Oxygen cost (energy expenditure) of running at a given submaximal speed. More economical runner uses less oxygen/energy to run at same pace as less economical runner. When combined with VO2 max and lactate threshold, running economy explains up to 90% of performance variance in distance events. Among runners with similar VO2 max, economy accounts for up to 65% of performance variation. Influenced by biomechanics, neuromuscular efficiency, body composition, training history, and metabolic factors.",

      "description": "Poor running economy due to inefficient mechanics and low training volume. High energy cost for given pace - uses significantly more oxygen than economical runners at same speed. Wasteful movement patterns clearly visible: excessive vertical oscillation (bouncing), poor posture, inefficient arm action, overstriding, tension throughout body. Biomechanically inefficient with multiple technical flaws. No economy-specific training history. Short training background limits neuromuscular adaptations that improve economy. High relative effort required for moderate paces. Cardiovascular and metabolic systems working hard to sustain paces that should feel easier. Demonstrates significant room for improvement through technical work, consistent training volume, and neuromuscular development over time. Economy improvements possible from multiple sources: better mechanics, increased training volume, strength development, years of consistent training."

      "description": "Improving economy as mechanics develop and training volume increases. Moderate energy cost for given pace - still uses more oxygen than highly trained runners but improving. Some inefficiencies remain: occasional overstriding, moderate tension, suboptimal arm action, excessive vertical motion. Biomechanics improving through technical work and motor learning. Beginning economy development through consistent training. Neuromuscular system adapting with training - better muscle fiber recruitment, improving tendon stiffness. Can sustain moderate paces with reasonable effort though still working harder than economical runners at same speed. Shows improvement trajectory with continued training. Economy responding to training volume increases, technical improvements, and time. Demonstrates potential for further development with consistent long-term training."

      "description": "Good running economy for training level enabling competitive performance at club level. Efficient mechanics at normal training paces - reasonable vertical oscillation, good posture, relaxed arms, appropriate stride parameters. Energy cost for speed reasonable though not elite. Consistent training background (multiple years) has produced neuromuscular adaptations improving economy. Can sustain training paces with appropriate effort levels. Biomechanically efficient enough for club-regional competition. Economy enabling competitive performances - can run similar times to athletes with higher VO2 max but poorer economy. Continued improvement potential exists through higher training volumes, advanced technical work, strength training, and additional training years. Demonstrates solid economy foundation with room for advancement."

      "label": "Advanced",
      "description": "Excellent running economy competitive at regional-national level. Very efficient mechanics across all training paces - minimal vertical oscillation, optimal stride parameters, relaxed yet powerful movement, biomechanically sound. Low energy cost for speed - uses significantly less oxygen than less economical runners at same pace. Extensive training background (5+ years consistent training) has optimized neuromuscular efficiency. Strong elastic properties in tendons provide energy return. Appropriate strength levels support economical running. Can sustain high paces with lower relative effort than less economical runners. Economy advantage measurable and meaningful - can outperform athletes with higher VO2 max through superior efficiency. Demonstrates advanced training status. Further improvements possible but incremental at this level. Economy among better runners at regional-national level."

      "label": "Elite",
      "description": "World-class running economy among the most efficient globally. Exceptional efficiency - minimal energy cost for elite speeds. Optimized biomechanics with perfect technique: minimal vertical oscillation, ideal stride parameters, complete relaxation, flawless movement quality. Neuromuscular patterns optimized through years (typically 8-12+ years) of consistent high-level training. Metabolic efficiency maximized - optimal mitochondrial function, ideal substrate utilization, efficient breathing. Perfect elastic properties provide maximal energy return. Strength-to-weight ratio optimized. Can sustain world-class paces with lower oxygen cost than any but the most elite runners globally. Economy advantage decisive at international level - often can compete successfully against athletes with higher VO2 max values. Demonstrates elite training status with long-term optimal development. Among most economical runners in the world. Economy enables Olympic or World Championship performance in endurance events."

  "assessmentGuidance": "True running economy requires laboratory measurement of oxygen consumption at standardized submaximal speeds (gold standard). Field assessment indirect: observe biomechanical efficiency looking for wasteful movements (excessive bouncing, poor mechanics, tension, overstriding). Note training history - economy improves with training years, typically requiring 5-10+ years of consistent training to optimize. Compare effort level to pace - economical runners sustain given paces with lower heart rate and perceived effort than uneconomical runners. Performance relative to VO2 max provides clues - athlete outperforming VO2 max predictions likely has superior economy. Video analysis helpful for identifying biomechanical inefficiencies. Track improvement over years as economy develops slowly with long-term training. Remember economy works together with VO2 max and lactate threshold to determine performance."
