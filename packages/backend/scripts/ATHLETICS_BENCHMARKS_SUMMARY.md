## Key Assumptions and Principles

### 1. Age-Appropriate Expectations

- **U10-U12:** Focus on fundamental movement, fun, multi-event exposure
- **U14-U16:** Event specialization begins, technical development emphasized
- **U18-U20:** Refined technique, competitive development
- **Senior:** Peak performance, elite development possible

### 2. Gender Differentiation

- **Technical skills** (running mechanics, form) are largely similar across genders
- **Performance standards** (times, power output) differ post-puberty (U14+)
- **Physiological benchmarks** account for gender-specific development patterns

### 3. Competitive Level Expectations

- **Developmental/Recreational:** Learning basics, participation focus (typically Level 1-2)
- **Competitive/Club:** Regular training, regional competition (typically Level 2-3)
- **Elite/National-International:** High-level training, national/international competition (typically Level 4-5)

### 4. Event Group Specificity

- **General skills** apply to all running events (most running mechanics, mental skills)
- **Event-specific skills** are targeted:
  - **Hurdle Clearance:** Only Hurdles event group
  - **Starting Blocks:** Primarily Sprints
  - **Speed Endurance:** Sprints and Middle Distance
  - **Aerobic Capacity:** Middle Distance and Long Distance

### 5. Progressive Development

- Expected levels increase with age and competitive level
- Benchmarks assume multi-year development pathway (8-12 years to reach elite levels)
- Progression paths guide coaches on next development steps

## Integration with PDP System

### Database Schema

Benchmarks are imported into the PDP system with the following mapping:

- **sport:** "athletics" (sportCode)
- **skillName:** Matches skill names in `athletics-level-descriptors-UPDATE.json`
- **ageGroup:** Maps to PDP age group system
- **gender:** "male" | "female" | "all" (some younger age groups may combine)
- **competitiveLevel:** "developmental" | "competitive" | "elite"
- **expectedLevel:** 1-5 rating, used as benchmark for skill assessments

### Assessment Workflow

1. Coach assesses athlete on specific skill (1-5 rating)
2. System retrieves appropriate benchmark based on athlete's age, gender, competitive level, event specialization
3. Comparison shows if athlete is below, at, or above expected level
4. Performance indicators guide specific coaching focus
5. Progression path suggests next development steps
