## Story
As an admin using the import wizard, I need the data quality report to appear after I've mapped columns and selected players, before the final review.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Add a 'Quality Check' step to the import wizard between player selection and review
- [ ] Update import-wizard.tsx step definitions to include the new step
- [ ] When entering the quality check step, run calculateDataQuality on the parsed/selected data
- [ ] Pass current mappings and selected rows to the scoring engine
- [ ] Show DataQualityReport component with the results
- [ ] When user clicks Apply Fix on an issue, update the row data in wizard state
- [ ] After applying fixes, re-run calculateDataQuality to update scores
- [ ] Continue button proceeds to review step
- [ ] Back button returns to player selection step
- [ ] If quality score is 'excellent' or 'good' (>=75), show optional skip message ('Quality looks great — skip to review?')
- [ ] Step indicator in wizard header shows the new step
- [ ] Run npx ultracite fix and npm run check-types
