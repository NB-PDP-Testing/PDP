# UAT Test: US-P2.3-004 - Add auto-save to import wizard

## Story
As an admin using the import wizard, I need my progress to be automatically saved after each step so I can resume later.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Update import-wizard.tsx to call saveDraft mutation after each step transition
- [ ] Debounce saves by 500ms to avoid rapid-fire mutations during fast navigation
- [ ] Save includes: current step number, mappings, player selections, benchmark settings, template ID, source file name, parsed headers, parsed row count
- [ ] Do NOT save raw parsed CSV data — too large for Convex documents
- [ ] Show subtle 'Saved' indicator (small text or icon) after successful save
- [ ] On wizard completion (import step succeeds), call deleteDraft to clean up
- [ ] On wizard cancellation, call deleteDraft to clean up
- [ ] Use useMutation from convex/react for saveDraft and deleteDraft
- [ ] Run npx ultracite fix
