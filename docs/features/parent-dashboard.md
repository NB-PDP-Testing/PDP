# Parent Dashboard & Role - Migration Analysis

## Executive Summary

The MVP's Parent Dashboard is a comprehensive family-focused interface that provides parents with insights into their children's development across multiple sports. This document analyzes all features and provides a migration strategy for the main application.

---

## 1. Core Features Overview

### 1.1 Parent Role & Authentication
- **Current MVP**: Parents are identified by email matching in the `players.parents[]` array
- **Filtering Logic**: Backend filters players where `player.parents[].email` matches the logged-in user's email
- **Multi-Child Support**: Parents can have multiple children, potentially across different sports
- **Multi-Sport Support**: Single child can play multiple sports (e.g., Soccer + GAA Football)
- **⚠️ CRITICAL: Multi-Organization Support**: 
  - A parent user may be a member of **multiple organizations**
  - Their children may be players in **different organizations**
  - The parent dashboard is **organization-scoped** (`/orgs/[orgId]/parents`)
  - Must filter players by BOTH parent email AND organization ID
  - May need organization switcher or cross-org summary view

### 1.2 Main Dashboard Components

#### A. Header Section
- **"Your Family's Journey"** - Gradient blue header
- Shows count of children being tracked **in current organization**
- Displays total number of sports across all children

## 2. Data Requirements

### 2.1 Player Data Needed
```typescript
interface PlayerForParent {
  // Basic Info
  name: string;
  sport: string;
  ageGroup: string;
  team: string;
  
  // Skills
  skills: Record<string, number>; // All skill ratings
  
  // Attendance
  attendance: {
    training: string; // e.g., "85%"
    matches: string;  // e.g., "90%"
  };
  
  // Goals & Actions
  actions?: string; // Structured text with 🎯 delimiters
  
  // Review Status
  reviewStatus: 'Not Started' | 'Completed' | 'Overdue' | 'Due Soon';
  lastReviewDate: string | null;
  
  // Coach Notes
  coachNotes?: string;
  
  // Injuries
  injuries?: Array<{
    injuryType: string;
    bodyPart: string;
    severity: string;
    status: 'Active' | 'Recovering' | 'Healed';
    dateOccurred: string;
  }>;
  
  // Parents Array (for matching)
  parents: Array<{
    id: string;
    firstName: string;
    surname: string;
    email: string;
    phone?: string;
    relationship?: string;
    isPrimary?: boolean;
  }>;
}
```

### 2.2 Backend Queries Needed

1. **Get Players for Parent**
   - Filter by `parents[].email` matching user email
   - Return all player data including skills, attendance, goals, injuries

2. **Get Schedule Data** (Future)
   - Training sessions per team
   - Match fixtures
   - Filtered by parent's children's teams

## 3. Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Dashboard Structure ✅ (Already Done)
- [x] Parent role identification via `functionalRoles`
- [x] Player filtering by parent email (via `linkPlayersToParent`)
- [x] Basic player passport view

### Phase 2: Dashboard Components (Recommended Order)

#### 2.1 Header & Summary Stats
**Priority**: High  
**Complexity**: Low  
**Files**:
- `apps/web/src/app/orgs/[orgId]/parents/page.tsx` (new)
- `apps/web/src/app/orgs/[orgId]/parents/components/family-header.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/app/orgs/[orgId]/parents/components/summary-stats.tsx`

**Backend**:
- Use existing `getMembersWithDetails` to get linked players
- Add query to get player review statuses

#### 2.2 Children Overview Cards
**Priority**: High  
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Files**:
- `apps/web/src/app/orgs/[orgId]/parents/components/child-card.tsx`

**Features**:
- Multi-sport grouping logic
- Performance score calculation
- Top skills extraction
- Attendance parsing and display
- Goals preview
- Injury summary
- Link to player passport

**Backend**:
- Ensure `getPlayerPassport` includes all needed data
- Add review status calculation

#### 2.3 Weekly Schedule Calendar
**Priority**: Medium  
**Complexity**: High  
**Files**:
- `apps/web/src/app/orgs/[orgId]/parents/components/weekly-schedule.tsx`

**Backend Requirements**:
- New table: `trainingSessions` (teamId, date, time, type)
- New table: `matches` (teamId, date, time, opponent)
- Query: `getScheduleForParent` (returns events for parent's children's teams)

**Note**: This requires significant backend work. Consider Phase 3 or use mock data initially.

#### 2.4 Coach Feedback Section
**Priority**: Medium  
**Complexity**: Low  
**Files**:
- `apps/web/src/app/orgs/[orgId]/parents/components/coach-feedback.tsx`

**Backend**:
- Use existing `coachNotes` field from player data
- Filter players with non-empty `coachNotes`

#### 2.5 AI Practice Assistant
**Priority**: Low (Nice to Have)  
**Complexity**: High  
**Files**:
- `apps/web/src/app/orgs/[orgId]/parents/components/ai-practice-assistant.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/app/orgs/[orgId]/parents/components/practice-plan-modal.tsx`

**Implementation Options**:
1. **Client-Side Generation** (MVP approach):
   - Analyze skills to find weakest
   - Generate drills based on sport
   - Link to goals
   - No AI/LLM needed

2. **Backend AI Integration** (Future):
   - Use OpenAI/Anthropic API
   - Generate more sophisticated plans
   - Store plans in database

**Recommendation**: Start with client-side generation (matches MVP), add AI later if needed.

## 4. Technical Implementation Details

### 4.1 Parent-Player Linking
**Current State**: 
- `linkPlayersToParent` mutation exists
- Links via email matching in `players.parents[]` array

**Migration**:
- Ensure parent's email from Better Auth matches `players.parents[].email`
- Use `getMembersWithDetails` to get linked players
- Filter players where `functionalRoles.includes("parent")`
- **⚠️ CRITICAL: Organization Scoping**:
  - Parent dashboard is at `/orgs/[orgId]/parents`
  - Must filter players by BOTH:
    1. Parent email match (`players.parents[].email === user.email`)
    2. Organization ID match (`player.organizationId === orgId`)
  - A parent may have children in multiple organizations
  - Each organization context shows only that org's children

### 4.2 Multi-Sport Grouping
```typescript
// Group players by name (same child, different sports)
const groupedPlayers = players.reduce((acc, player) => {
  const key = player.name;
  if (!acc[key]) {
    acc[key] = [];
  }
  acc[key].push(player);
  return acc;
}, {} as Record<string, Player[]>);
```

### 4.3 Skill Calculations
```typescript
// Get top 3 skills
const getTopSkills = (player: Player): Array<{name: string; rating: number}> => {
  const skills = player.skills as any;
  return Object.entries(skills)
    .filter(([, value]) => typeof value === 'number')
    .map(([key, value]) => ({ name: key, rating: value as number }))
    .sort((a, b) => b.rating - a.rating)
    .slice(0, 3);
};

// Get average rating
const getAverageRating = (player: Player): number => {
  const skills = player.skills as any;
  const ratings = Object.values(skills)
    .filter(v => typeof v === 'number') as number[];
  return ratings.length > 0 
    ? ratings.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) / ratings.length 
    : 0;
};
```

### 4.4 Attendance Parsing
```typescript
const parseAttendance = (attendance: string): number => {
  const match = attendance.match(/(\d+)%/);
  return match ? parseInt(match[1]) : 0;
};
```

### 4.5 Goals Parsing
```typescript
// Extract first goal from actions field
const firstGoal = player.actions?.split('🎯')[1]?.split('\n')[0] || 'Improve overall skills';

// Extract "How Parents Can Help"
const parentHelp = player.actions?.includes('👨‍👩‍👧 HOW PARENTS CAN HELP')
  ? player.actions.split('👨‍👩‍👧 HOW PARENTS CAN HELP:')[1]?.split('🎯')[0]
  : null;
```

## 5. Backend Changes Required

### 5.1 New Queries

#### `getPlayersForParent`
```typescript
export const getPlayersForParent = query({
  args: { organizationId: v.string() },
  returns: v.array(v.any()),
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const identity = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity();
    if (!identity) throw new Error("Not authenticated");
    
    const user = await ctx.runQuery(components.betterAuth.adapter.findOne, {
      model: "user",
      where: [{ field: "email", value: identity.email, operator: "eq" }],
    });
    
    if (!user) return [];
    
    // Get all players for THIS organization only
    const allPlayers = await ctx.db
      .query("players")
      .withIndex("by_organizationId", (q) => q.eq("organizationId", args.organizationId))
      .collect();
    
    // Filter by parent email AND organization (organization already filtered above)
    const normalizedEmail = identity.email.toLowerCase().trim();
    return allPlayers.filter((player) =>
      player.parents?.some((parent: any) =>
        parent.email?.toLowerCase().trim() === normalizedEmail
      )
    );
  },
});
```

#### `getParentChildrenCountAcrossOrgs` (Optional - for cross-org indicator)
```typescript
export const getParentChildrenCountAcrossOrgs = query({
  args: {},
  returns: v.record(v.string(), v.number()), // { orgId: count }
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    const identity = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity();
    if (!identity) throw new Error("Not authenticated");
    
    const normalizedEmail = identity.email.toLowerCase().trim();
    
    // Get all players across all organizations (where parent is linked)
    const allPlayers = await ctx.db
      .query("players")
      .collect();
    
    const parentPlayers = allPlayers.filter((player) =>
      player.parents?.some((parent: any) =>
        parent.email?.toLowerCase().trim() === normalizedEmail
      )
    );
    
    // Group by organization
    const orgCounts: Record<string, number> = {};
    for (const player of parentPlayers) {
      const orgId = player.organizationId;
      orgCounts[orgId] = (orgCounts[orgId] || 0) + 1;
    }
    
    return orgCounts;
  },
});
```

#### `getReviewStatus` (if not already calculated)
- Calculate based on `lastReviewDate` and review frequency
- Return: 'Not Started' | 'Completed' | 'Due Soon' | 'Overdue'

### 5.2 Schema Updates
- Ensure `players` table has:
  - `parents` array (already exists)
  - `reviewStatus` field (or calculate on-the-fly)
  - `lastReviewDate` field
  - `coachNotes` field
  - `injuries` array (if not exists)

## 8. Open Questions & Decisions Needed

1. **Multi-Organization UX**:
   - Should parent dashboard show organization switcher?
   - Should we show "X children in other organizations" indicator?
   - Should we have a cross-organization summary view?
   - How do we handle organization switching within parent dashboard?

2. **Schedule Data**: 
   - Do we have a teams/schedule system yet?
   - Should we build it or use mock data initially?

3. **AI Practice Plans**:
   - Client-side generation (MVP approach) or backend AI?
   - Should plans be saved/stored?

4. **Review Status**:
   - How is review frequency determined?
   - Per organization? Per team? Per sport?

5. **Injuries**:
   - Do we have an injuries system?
   - Should we build it or skip for now?

6. **Notifications**:
   - Should parents get notified of new coach notes?
   - Should parents get notified of upcoming reviews?
   - Should notifications be organization-scoped?

```

---

## Conclusion

The Parent Dashboard is a feature-rich component that requires careful planning. The recommended approach is to implement in phases, starting with core features (header, stats, child cards) and gradually adding advanced features (schedule, AI assistant).

**⚠️ Critical Architecture Consideration**: The parent dashboard must be **organization-scoped**. A parent user can be a member of multiple organizations, and their children may be in different organizations. The dashboard at `/orgs/[orgId]/parents` should:
1. Show only children in the current organization context
2. Provide clear organization context in the UI
3. Optionally show indicators if children exist in other organizations
4. Allow easy organization switching if needed

The MVP's client-side AI practice plan generation is a good starting point - it provides value without requiring complex backend AI integration.

Key success factors:
1. **Organization-scoped filtering** - Filter by both parent email AND organization ID
2. Proper parent-player linking via email
3. Multi-organization awareness and UX
4. Multi-sport athlete handling
5. Accurate performance calculations
6. Clean, intuitive UI matching MVP design
