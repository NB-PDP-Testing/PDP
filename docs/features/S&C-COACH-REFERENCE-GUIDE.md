## 🎯 The 6 Skill Categories

### 1️⃣ Running & Endurance
**Purpose:** Aerobic capacity and pacing for Hyrox 8km segments and GAA match endurance

| Skill | What You're Assessing |
|-------|----------------------|
| **Aerobic Capacity** | Ability to sustain 40-60+ minutes of continuous effort without decline |
| **Running Economy** | Efficiency of running gait - minimal wasted energy, good form under fatigue |
| **Pacing Strategy** | Ability to maintain consistent effort across race/match duration |
| **Recovery Between Efforts** | How quickly athlete recovers between high-intensity bouts (30-90 seconds) |

**Why This Matters:**
✓ Foundation for all endurance sports
✓ Critical for Hyrox completion (8km + stations)
✓ Essential for GAA match fitness (60-70 minutes)

---

### 2️⃣ Power & Strength
**Purpose:** Functional strength for sleds, carries, and GAA-specific power

| Skill | What You're Assessing |
|-------|----------------------|
| **Lower Body Strength** | Leg strength for squats, lunges, sled work, jumping (0.75-2x bodyweight range) |
| **Upper Body Strength** | Pressing/pulling strength for carries, wall balls, rowing, SkiErg |
| **Grip Strength** | Sustained grip for 200m farmers carry, sled pull, ball handling |
| **Explosive Power** | Rate of force production - jumping, sprinting, striking, tackling |
| **Strength Endurance** | Maintaining strength output for 30-50+ reps (wall balls, repeated efforts) |

**Why This Matters:**
✓ Required for all 8 Hyrox stations
✓ Injury prevention through strength foundation
✓ GAA contact situations and power movements

---

### 3️⃣ Core & Stability
**Purpose:** Core strength, balance, and stability for injury prevention and performance

| Skill | What You're Assessing |
|-------|----------------------|
| **Core Strength** | Anti-extension/rotation strength - plank holds 60-180+ seconds |
| **Balance & Stability** | Single-leg balance 10-30+ seconds, dynamic stability |
| **Hip Stability** | Glute strength, single-leg control, no knee valgus |
| **Postural Control** | Neutral spine maintenance under load and fatigue |

**Why This Matters:**
✓ Foundation for all movement

| **Acceleration (0-10m)** | First step quickness and explosive start from static position |
| **Change of Direction** | Pre-planned cutting ability - decelerate, cut, re-accelerate |
| **Reactive Agility** | Response to stimulus - unpredictable direction changes (GAA-specific) |
| **Repeated Sprint Ability** | Maintaining 85-90%+ speed across 8-10 sprint bouts |

**Why This Matters:**
✓ GAA match performance (bursts, direction changes)
✓ Hyrox transitions between stations
✓ Competitive advantage in both sports

---

### 5️⃣ Hyrox Stations
**Purpose:** Technique and efficiency for the 8 Hyrox competition stations

| Station | What You're Assessing | Distance/Reps |

| **Wall Balls** | Squat depth, timing, rhythm, endurance | 100 reps |

**Why This Matters:**
✓ Hyrox-specific race preparation
✓ Identifies weak stations for targeted training
✓ Technique over strength in most stations

**Age Relevance:**
- U14: Basic technique introduction (lighter loads)

## 📋 Assessment Protocol

### Pre-Assessment Checklist

- ☐ Health screening completed (injury history, medical clearance)
- ☐ Athlete well-rested (no training 24h prior)
- ☐ Hydrated and fed (2-3 hours before)
- ☐ Appropriate clothing and footwear
- ☐ Equipment checked and ready

### Standardized Warm-Up (15 minutes)

1. **General Warm-Up (5 min):** Light jog, dynamic stretches
2. **Movement Prep (5 min):** Squats, lunges, arm circles, leg swings
3. **Specific Warm-Up (5 min):** Practice movements to be tested

### Testing Order (Minimize Fatigue Effects)

**Session 1 (45-60 minutes):**
1. Movement Quality (squat, hinge, mobility) - 10 min
2. Core & Stability (planks, balance) - 10 min
3. Speed & Agility (sprints, COD) - 15 min
4. Power Tests (jumps, throws) - 10 min

**Session 2 (45-60 minutes) - Different Day:**
5. Strength Tests (squat, push, pull) - 20 min
6. Hyrox Station Technique - 15 min
7. Endurance Test (last, most fatiguing) - 20 min

### Safety Guidelines

**Youth Athletes (U14-U16):**
- ⚠️ Never max testing under age 14
- ⚠️ Technique before load always
- ⚠️ Progress gradually over 12-week blocks
- ⚠️ Supervise all testing

**All Athletes:**
- 🛑 Stop if technique breaks down
- 🛑 Stop if pain (not discomfort) occurs
- 🛑 Adequate rest between tests (2-5 minutes)
- 🛑 Medical clearance for elite testing

### Recording Results

For each skill, record:
- **Rating (1-5):** Your assessment
- **Notes:** Observations, technique points
- **Context:** Training/match/trial/formal review
- **Conditions:** Equipment, weather, time of day

## 📊 Interpreting Results

### Benchmark Status Meanings

| Status | Symbol | What It Means | Action Required |
|--------|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Below** | 🔴 | Rating < Min Acceptable | Priority focus area, significant work needed |
| **Developing** | 🟠 | Min Acceptable ≤ Rating < Expected | Continue development, on right track |
| **On Track** | 🟡 | Expected ≤ Rating < Excellent | Meeting standards, maintain progress |
| **Exceeding** | 🟢 | Excellent ≤ Rating < 5.0 | Above standards, potential strength |
| **Exceptional** | 🟢 | Rating = 5.0 | Outstanding, role model level |

### Using Results for Programming

**Priority Matrix:**

```
HIGH IMPORTANCE + LOW RATING = TOP PRIORITY
│
│  Movement Quality  │  Speed & Agility
│  (fix first)       │  (work on soon)
│
├─────────────────────────────────────
│
│  Endurance         │  Strength
│  (maintain)        │  (maintain)
│
LOW IMPORTANCE + HIGH RATING = MAINTAIN
```

**Example Athlete Profile:**

| Category | Rating | Status | Priority |
|----------|--------|--------|----------|
| Movement Quality | 2.5 | 🔴 Below | 🔥 1st - Fix technique |
| Core Strength | 2.5 | 🟠 Developing | 🔥 2nd - Build foundation |
| Lower Body Strength | 2.0 | 🔴 Below | 🔥 3rd - Need strength |
| Sprint Speed | 3.5 | 🟡 On Track | ✓ Maintain |
| Aerobic Capacity | 4.0 | 🟢 Exceeding | ✓ Maintain |

**Training Focus:** 12 weeks on movement quality + core + strength, maintain endurance/speed

## 💡 Pro Tips for Coaches

### Getting Accurate Ratings

✅ **DO:**
- Observe multiple sessions before rating
- Test under various conditions (fresh vs fatigued)
- Use video analysis for movement quality
- Compare to benchmark descriptors, not other athletes
- Rate conservatively - easier to upgrade than downgrade

❌ **DON'T:**
- Rate based on one session only
- Inflate ratings to "be nice"
- Compare athletes to each other
- Guess - if unsure, observe more
- Rate when athlete is injured or ill

### Common Rating Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Happens | Solution |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| **Over-rating** | Wanting athlete to feel good | Use descriptors objectively |
| **Under-rating** | High standards, comparing to elite | Use age-appropriate benchmarks |
| **Inconsistent** | Rating criteria changes | Review descriptors before each session |
| **Recency bias** | Latest session weighs too heavily | Consider 4-6 week average |

### Using with Athletes

**Feedback Best Practices:**
1. Start with **strengths** (what's on track or exceeding)
2. Frame **development areas** positively ("opportunity to improve")
3. Show **progress over time** (compare to previous assessments)
4. Link to **goals** (e.g., "improving this will help your Hyrox time")
5. Create **action plan** (2-3 focus areas max)

**Parent Communication:**
- Use benchmark status colors (easy visual)
- Explain what "on track" means for their age
- Emphasize long-term development over short-term results
- Share progress trends, not just current ratings
