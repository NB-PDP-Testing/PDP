## Errors Encountered
-    730→   - Error handling: try/catch, marks artifact as "failed" on error

## Gotchas & Learnings
- Looking at the PRD: US-VN-018 has `"passes": false` but the progress file says "PHASE 5 COMPLETE" with both stories done. The docs commit (40641eec) says "update PRD and progress for US-VN-018 completion (Phase 5 complete)" - so the PRD was supposed to be updated but the passes field is still false. Let me check the current state of the PRD more carefully.
