> Auto-generated: 2026-01-27 18:36
> Status: ⏳ Pending Execution

## Story
As a Level 0-1 coach, I want to see the 'Sent to Parents' tab so I can view summaries I've sent without needing Level 2+.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Modify apps/web/src/app/orgs/[orgId]/coach/voice-notes/components/auto-approved-tab.tsx
- [ ] Find trust level check that hides tab for Level 0-1 (likely: if (coachTrustLevel < 2) return <EmptyState />)
- [ ] Remove the entire trust level check - delete the if statement
- [ ] Tab should be visible to ALL coaches (Level 0+)
- [ ] Existing functionality preserved: search, filter, parent view status still work
- [ ] Type check passes: npm run check-types
- [ ] Visual verification: Navigate to voice notes dashboard as Level 0 coach, verify tab visible
- [ ] Test with Level 0, Level 1, and Level 2 coaches (tab visible for all)
