## Story
As an admin who just completed an import, I need easy access to undo from the completion screen and import entry page.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Update complete-step.tsx: add 'Undo Import' link/button below the success message
- [ ] Undo link only shown for the just-completed import session
- [ ] Clicking opens UndoImportDialog with the session ID
- [ ] Update import entry page (apps/web/src/app/orgs/[orgId]/import/page.tsx): add 'View Import History' link
- [ ] History link navigates to /orgs/[orgId]/import/history
- [ ] If the most recent session was completed <24h ago, show a subtle 'Last import can be undone' notification
- [ ] Add 'Import History' link to admin sidebar (same section as Import Wizard)
- [ ] Run npx ultracite fix and npm run check-types
