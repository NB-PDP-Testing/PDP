## Story
As a backend developer, I need to create a query that aggregates coach activity across 6 tables so the My Impact dashboard can display comprehensive coaching metrics.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Create getCoachImpactSummary query in packages/backend/convex/models/voiceNotes.ts
- [ ] Query accepts args: { coachId: v.string(), organizationId: v.string(), dateRange: v.object({ start: v.number(), end: v.number() }) }
- [ ] Query returns typed object with:
- [ ] voiceNotesCreated: v.number()
- [ ] insightsApplied: v.number()
- [ ] insightsDismissed: v.number()
- [ ] summariesSent: v.number()
- [ ] summariesViewed: v.number()
- [ ] summariesAcknowledged: v.number()
- [ ] parentViewRate: v.number() - calculated as (summariesViewed / summariesSent) * 100
- [ ] skillChanges: v.array() - recent skill changes from autoAppliedInsights
- [ ] injuriesRecorded: v.array() - recent injuries where source='voice_note'
- [ ] recentSummaries: v.array() - last 10 sent summaries
- [ ] teamObservations: v.array() - team-level insights
- [ ] parentEngagement: v.array() - per-parent engagement stats
- [ ] weeklyTrends: v.array() - last 4 weeks of sent/viewed data
- [ ] Query uses .withIndex() for ALL sub-queries (NEVER .filter())
- [ ] Query aggregates from 6 tables: voiceNotes, voiceNoteInsights, coachParentSummaries, autoAppliedInsights, playerInjuries, teamObservations
- [ ] Date range filtering: Fetch from index with .gte(start), then filter .lte(end) in JavaScript
- [ ] Handle edge cases: no data returns zeros, coach not found returns null
- [ ] Include complete args and returns validators
- [ ] Type check passes: npm run check-types
- [ ] Run codegen: npx -w packages/backend convex codegen
