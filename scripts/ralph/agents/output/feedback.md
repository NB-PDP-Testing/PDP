## PRD Audit - US-VN-018 - 2026-02-07 14:02:06
## US-VN-018 Audit Result: **PARTIAL**

### What's Implemented (PASS)

| Criteria | Status |
|----------|--------|
| **Page file exists** at correct path | PASS |
| **Header**: "Resolve Player Mentions" with back button | PASS |
| **Summary card**: Shows unique names and total mentions | PASS |
| **[E6] Grouped by rawText**: Multiple claims → one card with "N claims" badge | PASS |
| **Radio group** with candidates per mention group | PASS |
| **[E4] Match reason badges**: All reason types mapped (irish_alias, fuzzy_full_name, etc.) | PASS |
| **"+team_context" badge**: "On your team" rendered | PASS |
| **Similarity % bar**: Colored green/yellow/red by score thresholds | PASS |
| **"None of these" option** with unresolved marking | PASS |
| **"Confirm" button per group** with org theme color | PASS |
| **"Skip All Remaining" button** at bottom (sticky bar) | PASS |
| **Queries lifted to parent** (single `useQuery` at page level, not in list items) | PASS |
| **resolveEntity mutation**: Auth guard, status update, parent claim update | PASS |
| **[E6] Batch resolution**: Same rawText resolutions updated in resolveEntity | PASS |
| **[E5] Coach alias upsert**: Inline in resolveEntity mutation (not via scheduler) | PASS |
| **[E3] Analytics**: `disambiguate_accept`, `disambiguate_reject_all`, `disambiguate_skip` all logged via `ctx.scheduler.runAfter(0, ...)` | PASS |
| **reviewAnalytics** extended with new event types | PASS |
| **coachPlayerAliases** table and schema | PASS |
| **Navigation banner**: DisambiguationBanner on voice notes list page with count | PASS |
| **Mobile**: Sticky bottom bar, scrolling list | PASS |
| **Schema/indexes** for voiceNoteEntityResolutions and coachPlayerAliases | PASS |

### Gaps Found (MISSING)

| Criteria | Status | Detail |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **"Save All" button** | MISSING | AC specifies both "Save All" and "Skip All Remaining" at bottom. Only "Skip All Remaining" exists. |
| **Claim sourceText with rawText highlighted** | MISSING | AC says "Show representative claim sourceText with rawText mention highlighted (bold/underline)". The card only shows the rawText in quotes, not the surrounding claim sourceText. |
| **Claim topic badge** | MISSING | AC says "Show claim topic badge (reuse TOPIC_CONFIG pattern from v2-claims page)". No topic badge displayed on mention group cards. |
| **"Appears in N claims" text** | PARTIAL | Shows "N claims" as a badge, but AC specifies text saying "Appears in N claims". Minor wording difference. |
| **Tooltip on Irish alias badge** | MISSING | AC says tooltip showing alias pair (e.g., "Shawn = Sean"). No tooltips implemented. |
| **Touch targets >= 44px** | UNCLEAR | `p-3` (12px padding) on candidate buttons may result in < 44px total height depending on content. Not explicitly enforced with `min-h-[44px]`. |
| **skipResolution doesn't change status** | CONCERN | The `skipResolution` mutation only logs analytics but doesn't mark the resolution as skipped - these items will remain in `needs_disambiguation` and reappear on next visit. |
| **Navigation back when all resolved** | PARTIAL | Empty state shows a "Back to Voice Notes" button, but no auto-navigation on completion. |

### Summary

The core functionality is solid - resolution, batch E6 grouping, E5 alias storage, E3 analytics, and the disambiguation UI with candidate selection all work. The main gaps are presentational: missing claim sourceText context, missing topic badges, no "Save All" button, and no tooltips on Irish alias badges. The `skipResolution` mutation not changing status is a functional concern that will cause skipped items to reappear.

**Verdict: PARTIAL** - ~80% complete. The backend is fully implemented. The frontend is missing 3-4 display requirements from the AC.
