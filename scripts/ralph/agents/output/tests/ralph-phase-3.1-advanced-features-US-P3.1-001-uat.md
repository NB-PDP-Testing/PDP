## Story
As an admin reviewing import duplicates, I need to see confidence scores for guardian matches so I can make informed decisions about auto-linking.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Extend guardian matching backend to calculate and return confidence scores (0-100)
- [ ] Confidence score based on: name similarity, email match, phone match, address match
- [ ] Each match signal weighted: email 40%, phone 30%, name 20%, address 10%
- [ ] Store confidence score in match result object returned by guardianMatcher
- [ ] Backend mutation returns confidence score with each duplicate guardian match
- [ ] Confidence score persists in importSessions duplicates array
- [ ] Run npx -w packages/backend convex codegen to verify types
- [ ] Run npx ultracite fix before completion
