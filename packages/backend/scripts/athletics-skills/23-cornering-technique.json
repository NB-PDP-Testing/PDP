  "category": "Technical & Event-Specific",
  "description": "Running efficiently around curve while maintaining speed in 200m, 400m, and other events with turns. Slight inward lean from ankles (not waist), left arm drives across body, right arm swings wider for balance. Inside (left) shoulder drops slightly. Maintain relaxation and rhythm despite asymmetric forces. Sprint explosively out of curve into straightaway. Particularly important in inside lanes (1-3) with tighter radius requiring greater lean and technical precision.",

      "label": "Developing",
      "description": "Poor cornering technique resulting in significant speed loss and inefficiency. Runs upright with no lean, fighting centrifugal forces rather than working with them. Arms swing normally (symmetrically) rather than adjusting for curve - right arm crossing body, left arm too narrow. Shoulders level instead of left shoulder dropping. Tenses up on curves, rhythm becomes choppy and strained. Slows noticeably entering curve and cannot re-accelerate through or out of curve. Drifts toward outside lane due to inadequate inward lean and body position. Appears uncomfortable and mechanical on curves. Cannot maintain form on tighter radius (inside lanes) - technique completely breaks down. Demonstrates no understanding of cornering biomechanics. Loses substantial time on curves compared to straightaways. Cannot execute curve efficiently regardless of lane assignment."

      "label": "Emerging",
      "description": "Basic cornering ability developing but significant inefficiencies remain. Attempts some inward lean but often from waist rather than ankles, or insufficient angle. Beginning to adjust arms - left arm crosses somewhat, right arm wider - but asymmetry inconsistent. Some shoulder drop attempted but not natural. Still tenses moderately on curves, rhythm less smooth than straightaways. Speed loss reduced but still noticeable entering and through curves. Lane discipline improving but may still drift slightly. Uncomfortable in inside lanes (1-3) with tighter radius. Responds to coaching cues (\"lean in,\" \"left arm across,\" \"relax\") during drills but struggles to maintain in races. Shows improvement trajectory. Can complete curve events (200m, 400m) but cornering remains weakness. Demonstrates awareness of cornering technique concepts but inconsistent execution."

      "label": "Competent",
      "description": "Good cornering technique enabling competent curve running. Appropriate inward lean from ankles (not waist) matching curve radius and speed. Arms adjust properly - left arm drives across body, right arm wider providing balance. Left shoulder drops naturally creating efficient body position. Maintains relaxation and rhythm through curves comparable to straightaways. Limited speed loss on curves, can maintain race pace through turns. Stays in lane efficiently without drifting. Handles inside lanes reasonably well though may prefer middle lanes. Sprints effectively out of curve into straightaway. Can self-correct if technique feels off. Competitive at club-regional level in curve events. Demonstrates solid understanding of cornering biomechanics. Time splits show minimal differential between curve and straight portions relative to ability level. Comfortable racing in any lane assignment."

      "label": "Advanced",
      "description": "Excellent cornering technique competitive at regional-national level. Perfect inward lean from ankles precisely calibrated for speed and curve radius. Arms adjusted optimally - left arm powerful cross-body drive, right arm wide for perfect balance. Left shoulder drop natural and effective. Maintains complete relaxation and rhythm through curves - appears as comfortable on curves as straightaways. Minimal to no speed loss on curves, can maintain or accelerate through turns. Perfect lane discipline, never drifts. Excels in inside lanes, technical precision handles tight radius efficiently. Explosive acceleration out of curve into straight. Competitive advantage through superior cornering - can make up ground on competitors in turns. Can demonstrate perfect technique and explain biomechanics. Serves as model for cornering technique. Time splits show curve portions run at same or faster pace than straightaways accounting for distance."

      "label": "Elite",
      "description": "World-class cornering technique among the most efficient globally. Biomechanically perfect inward lean and body position for elite speeds and varying curve radii. Arms demonstrate perfect asymmetric drive optimizing power transfer and balance. Demonstrates complete mastery appearing more comfortable on curves than straightaways despite asymmetric forces. Maintains or accelerates through curves at world-record pace. Perfect lane discipline. Dominates inside lane assignments turning tight radius into advantage through superior technique. Explosive out of curves. Competitive advantage decisive - gains significant ground on competitors during curve portions. Demonstrates championship-level technique during Olympic or World Championship 200m/400m finals. Among the best globally at maintaining speed through curves. Serves as international technical model. Time splits show curve portions run faster than straightaways when accounting for distance, demonstrating superior curve efficiency. No technical flaws observable under any circumstance including major championship finals in tight-radius lanes."

  "assessmentGuidance": "Observe during 200m and 400m running on curves. Watch body position: lean from ankles versus waist or upright, lean angle appropriate for speed and radius. Note arm action: left arm crossing body, right arm wider, asymmetry maintained. Observe shoulder position: left dropping, right higher. Listen to rhythm and footfall pattern on curve versus straight. Measure or observe lane position: drifting outward indicates insufficient lean, drifting inward suggests excessive. Compare speed on curve portions to straightaways using split times. Note comfort level in different lane assignments, particularly inside lanes. Video analysis helpful for detailed biomechanical review. This skill applies primarily to 200m and 400m specialists but relevant for 800m and relay curve running as well."
