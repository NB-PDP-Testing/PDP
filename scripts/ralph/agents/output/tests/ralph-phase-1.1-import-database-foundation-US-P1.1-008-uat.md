# UAT Test: US-P1.1-008 - Seed default import templates

> Auto-generated: 2026-02-12 16:04
> Status: ⏳ Pending Execution

## Story
As the platform, I need pre-configured templates for GAA Foireann exports and generic CSV imports so users can import immediately.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Create packages/backend/convex/models/importTemplateSeeds.ts with seed data
- [ ] Create a seedDefaultTemplates mutation that inserts templates if they don't already exist
- [ ] GAA Foireann template: sportCode 'gaa_football', sourceType 'csv', scope 'platform', with 10+ column mappings (Forename->firstName, Surname->lastName, DOB->dateOfBirth, gender->gender, email->parentEmail, Mobile Number->parentPhone, Address1->address, Postcode->postcode, Town->town)
- [ ] Generic CSV template: sportCode null (works for all sports), sourceType 'csv', scope 'platform', with regex-based column mappings for common field patterns
- [ ] Both templates have skillInitialization strategy 'age-appropriate' for GAA, 'blank' for generic
- [ ] Templates marked isActive: true
