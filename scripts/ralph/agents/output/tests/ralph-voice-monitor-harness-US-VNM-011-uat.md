Create metrics/page.tsx with time range selector, metric cards, and CSS-based charts. NO external charting libraries. READ FULL DETAILS in phases/PHASE_M6_M7_M8_M9.json.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Create apps/web/src/app/platform/voice-monitoring/metrics/page.tsx

- [ ] - Latency by stage (stacked bar using nested divs)
- [ ] - Error rate trend (line chart using CSS/SVG polyline)
- [ ] - Cost trend (area chart using gradients)
- [ ] Build org breakdown table (per-org volume, latency, cost, error rate)
- [ ] Query getHistoricalMetrics with correct periodType (hourly < 7d, daily > 7d)
- [ ] Run: npm run check-types
