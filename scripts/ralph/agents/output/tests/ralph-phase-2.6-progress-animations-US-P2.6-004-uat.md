## Story
As a user running an import with errors, I need to see errors as they occur (not just at the end) so I can decide whether to cancel the import.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Extend progress tracker to include errors array: { rowNumber, playerName, error, timestamp }[]
- [ ] Update batchImportPlayersWithIdentity mutation to append errors to progress tracker as they occur
- [ ] Add collapsible 'Errors' section below current operation in import-step.tsx
- [ ] Errors section shows count badge: 'Errors (3)' with red background
- [ ] Click to expand shows scrollable error list (max height 200px)
- [ ] Each error item shows: Row #X: [PlayerName] - [Error message]
- [ ] Errors appear in real-time as import progresses (poll updates them)
- [ ] New errors fade in with framer-motion animation
- [ ] Error list auto-scrolls to bottom when new error added
- [ ] On import completion, error section stays expanded if errors exist
- [ ] If no errors, 'Errors' section shows 'No errors (0)' with green checkmark
- [ ] Mobile responsive: error list scrolls, text wraps properly
- [ ] Run npx ultracite fix
