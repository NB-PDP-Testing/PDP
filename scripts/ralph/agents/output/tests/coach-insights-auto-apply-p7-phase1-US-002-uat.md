## Story
As a coach, I see which insights would auto-apply at my current trust level.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Create packages/backend/convex/models/voiceNoteInsights.ts
- [ ] Create getPendingInsights query:
- [ ] Args: { organizationId: v.string(), coachId: v.string(), status: v.optional(v.string()) }
- [ ] Returns: v.array(v.object({ ...insight fields, wouldAutoApply: v.boolean() }))
- [ ] Query voiceNoteInsights TABLE (NOT embedded array!):
- [ ] .withIndex('by_coach_org_status', q => q.eq('coachId', ...).eq('organizationId', ...).eq('status', ...))
- [ ] Get coach trust level from coachTrustLevels table
- [ ] Calculate wouldAutoApply for each insight:
- [ ] const effectiveLevel = Math.min(trustLevel?.currentLevel ?? 0, trustLevel?.preferredLevel ?? trustLevel?.currentLevel ?? 0)
- [ ] const threshold = trustLevel?.insightConfidenceThreshold ?? 0.7
- [ ] const wouldAutoApply = insight.category !== 'injury' && insight.category !== 'medical' && effectiveLevel >= 2 && insight.confidenceScore >= threshold
- [ ] Return insights with wouldAutoApply field added
- [ ] Type check passes: npm run check-types
