## Story
As the import system, I need a wizard component that orchestrates the multi-step import flow with state management.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Create apps/web/src/components/import/ImportWizard.tsx
- [ ] Define 7 wizard steps with step indicator at top
- [ ] Manage wizard state: currentStep, template, sportCode, parsedData, mappings, playerSelections, benchmarkSettings, sessionId
- [ ] Support Next/Back navigation between steps
- [ ] Conditional step skipping (skip Map Columns if 100% auto-mapped, skip Review if no issues)
- [ ] Create import session on wizard start
