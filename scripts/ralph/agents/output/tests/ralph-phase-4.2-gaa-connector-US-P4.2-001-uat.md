## Story
As a platform admin, I need to configure the GAA Foireann connector with API endpoints and default settings so clubs can connect to Foireann.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Create seed data for GAA Foireann connector in importTemplateSeeds.ts
- [ ] Connector name: 'GAA Foireann'
- [ ] federationCode: 'gaa_foireann'
- [ ] authType: 'oauth2' (Foireann uses OAuth 2.0)
- [ ] endpoints.membershipList: 'https://api.foireann.ie/v2/clubs/{clubId}/members'
- [ ] endpoints.memberDetail: 'https://api.foireann.ie/v2/members/{memberId}'
- [ ] syncConfig.conflictStrategy: 'federation_wins' (Foireann is source of truth)
- [ ] Link to GAA Foireann import template (created in Phase 1.1)
- [ ] status: 'inactive' (requires OAuth setup per club)
- [ ] Add seedGAAConnector mutation to create connector if not exists
- [ ] Run npx -w packages/backend convex codegen
