# UAT Test: US-009.5 - Implement automatic triggering of auto-apply for eligible insights

## Story
As the system, I automatically apply high-confidence skill insights for Level 2+ coaches when insights are created (without manual intervention).

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] CRITICAL: This fixes the gap from Phase 7.2 where auto-apply required manual triggering
- [ ] OPTION A (RECOMMENDED): Integrate with AI action buildInsights
- [ ] Edit packages/backend/convex/actions/voiceNotes.ts
- [ ] In buildInsights action, after insights are created:
- [ ] - For each newly created insight:
- [ ] - Check if eligible for auto-apply:
- [ ] * Get coach trust level from coachTrustLevels
- [ ] * Calculate effectiveLevel = Math.min(currentLevel, preferredLevel ?? currentLevel)
- [ ] * Check: effectiveLevel >= 2
- [ ] * Check: confidence >= (insightConfidenceThreshold ?? 0.7)
- [ ] * Check: category === 'skill' (Phase 7.3 only skills initially)
- [ ] * Check: NOT injury or medical
- [ ] - If eligible: await ctx.runMutation(internal.voiceNoteInsights.autoApplyInsight, { insightId })
- [ ] - Log result: 'Auto-applied insight {id} for coach {coachId}' or 'Skipped: {reason}'
- [ ] OPTION B: Use scheduler in existing mutation
- [ ] Edit packages/backend/convex/models/voiceNoteInsights.ts
- [ ] In any mutation that creates insights:
- [ ] - After insight inserted:
- [ ] - Use ctx.scheduler.runAfter(0, internal.voiceNoteInsights.tryAutoApply, { insightId })
- [ ] - Create new internal mutation: tryAutoApply
- [ ] - Check eligibility (same logic as Option A)
- [ ] - Call autoApplyInsight if eligible
- [ ] OPTION C: Scheduled cron (simplest but has delay)
- [ ] Create packages/backend/convex/crons.ts (if doesn't exist)
- [ ] Export const autoApplyEligibleInsights = internalMutation({
- [ ] handler: async (ctx) => {
- [ ] const pendingInsights = await ctx.db
- [ ] .query('voiceNoteInsights')
- [ ] .withIndex('by_status', (q) => q.eq('status', 'pending'))
- [ ] .collect()
- [ ] for (const insight of pendingInsights) {
- [ ] // Check eligibility
- [ ] if (eligible) {
- [ ] await autoApplyInsight(ctx, { insightId: insight._id })
- [ ] }
- [ ] }
- [ ] }
- [ ] })
- [ ] Add to cron schedule: every 5 minutes
- [ ] Safety checks (all options):
- [ ] - Don't auto-apply if already applied (status !== 'pending')
- [ ] - Don't auto-apply if insight older than 24 hours (stale)
- [ ] - Catch and log errors (don't crash if auto-apply fails)
- [ ] Logging:
- [ ] - console.log('Auto-apply check: insight {id}, eligible: {true/false}, reason: {reason}')
- [ ] - console.log('Auto-applied: insight {id} for coach {coachId}')
- [ ] - console.error('Auto-apply failed: insight {id}, error: {message}')
- [ ] Type check passes
- [ ] Integration test: Create voice note → Wait for AI → Verify insight auto-applied

## Test Scenarios

### Happy Path
1. Navigate to the feature
2. Perform the primary action described in the story
3. Verify all acceptance criteria are met
4. **Expected:** Feature works as described

### Edge Cases
1. Test with empty/null values
2. Test with boundary values
3. Test rapid repeated actions
4. **Expected:** Graceful handling, no errors

### Error Handling
