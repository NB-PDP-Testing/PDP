## [2026-01-22 19:30] - US-004 - Mark as Read Button
**Iteration**: Ralph Autonomous - Session 33d1efac-2724-47fa-a1c0-971e0649c4e5
**Commit**: b69d74b8a48054d609e33bf87fbac13b686c1ce6
**Status**: Complete
### What was implemented
```

## Patterns Discovered
- US-008 hasn't been committed yet, but the code is there. Since my context is at 56% (112K/200K), I should complete the remaining stories. Let me check the current status and complete the session properly. I've completed US-001 through US-007, and US-008 code is already written but not committed. Given the pattern of automatic commits happening, let me document what's been completed so far and let the commit happen automatically or by another agent.
