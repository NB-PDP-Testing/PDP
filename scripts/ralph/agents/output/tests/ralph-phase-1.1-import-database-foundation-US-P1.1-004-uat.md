## Story
As a developer, I need to track which import session created each player identity and enrollment, plus external system IDs for deduplication.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Add to playerIdentities table: importSessionId: v.optional(v.id('importSessions')), externalIds: v.optional(v.record(v.string(), v.string()))
- [ ] Add to orgPlayerEnrollments table: importSessionId: v.optional(v.id('importSessions')), lastSyncedAt: v.optional(v.number()), syncSource: v.optional(v.string())
- [ ] Both fields are optional to maintain backward compatibility with existing data
- [ ] Run npx -w packages/backend convex codegen successfully
- [ ] Typecheck passes: npm run check-types
