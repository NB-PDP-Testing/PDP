## Story
Democratic voting system backend with weighted votes.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Modify packages/backend/convex/schema.ts (add teamDecisions + decisionVotes tables)
- [ ] Create packages/backend/convex/models/teamDecisions.ts
- [ ] Add teamDecisions table with fields: organizationId, teamId, createdBy, title, description, options, votingType, status, deadline, winningOption, timestamps
- [ ] Add decisionVotes table with fields: decisionId, userId, optionId, weight, comment, votedAt
- [ ] Add indexes: by_team, by_team_and_status, by_org, by_org_and_status for teamDecisions
- [ ] Add indexes: by_decision, by_decision_and_user, by_user for decisionVotes
- [ ] Export createDecision mutation (args: orgId, teamId, title, description, options, votingType, deadline | returns: decisionId)
- [ ] Export castVote mutation (args: decisionId, optionId, comment | returns: voteId | calculates weight: owner/admin=2.0, coach=1.0, other=0.5 | upserts vote if user already voted)
- [ ] Export finalizeDecision mutation (args: decisionId | returns: decisionId | only head coach/admin can finalize | calculates weighted totals | sets winningOption)
- [ ] Export getTeamDecisions query (args: teamId, status (optional) | returns: array of decisions with vote counts and user names enriched via Better Auth adapter)
- [ ] Export getDecisionVotes query (args: decisionId | returns: array of votes with user names enriched)
- [ ] All functions use withIndex() for queries
- [ ] All functions use Better Auth adapter for user enrichment
- [ ] Batch fetch users to avoid N+1 queries (Map lookup pattern)
- [ ] All functions have args + returns validators
- [ ] Create activity feed entries for decision_created, vote_cast, decision_finalized
- [ ] Type check passes
- [ ] Run npx -w packages/backend convex codegen
- [ ] Test in Convex dashboard: create decision, cast votes, verify weight calculation, finalize, verify winning option
