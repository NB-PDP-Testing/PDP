## Story
As the system, I need to automatically clean up expired drafts to prevent storage bloat.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Add daily cron job to packages/backend/convex/crons.ts
- [ ] Cron runs cleanupExpiredDrafts internalMutation once per day
- [ ] Use the existing crons.ts pattern (check if file exists, follow existing cron registration pattern)
- [ ] If crons.ts does not exist, create it following Convex cron documentation: import { cronJobs } from 'convex/server', define crons, export default
- [ ] Run npx -w packages/backend convex codegen to verify
