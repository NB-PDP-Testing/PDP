  "description": "Ability to maintain attention on performance-relevant cues throughout training and competition while blocking out distractions. External focus (task at hand - arm drive, relaxation, pacing) associated with lower perceived effort and better performance than internal focus (body sensations, fatigue). Concentration control separates elite from sub-elite performers - ability to focus on important cues and ignore irrelevant information. Developed through practice and mental training including mindfulness, attention control exercises, and competition experience.",

      "description": "Very poor focus and concentration limiting performance. Cannot maintain attention on any performance cue for more than few seconds before mind wanders. Easily distracted by everything: other athletes, crowd noise, weather, internal thoughts, bodily sensations. During races, thinking about everything except executing race plan: worried about competitors, thinking about finish time, focused on pain and discomfort, replaying past failures. Cannot follow even simple pre-race routine - forgets steps or gets distracted partway through. Attention flits randomly between internal sensations (\"I'm tired,\" \"this hurts\") and irrelevant external stimuli (crowd, weather, appearance). No ability to refocus when concentration breaks - stays distracted once attention wanders. Demonstrates no concentration control skills. In training, cannot focus on technique cues or workout purpose - just goes through motions. Shows no awareness that focus matters for performance."

      "description": "Basic focus developing but highly inconsistent and fragile. Can maintain attention on performance cue for short periods (10-30 seconds) before losing focus. Still easily distracted but becoming aware when attention wanders. During races, focus scattered - some attention on execution but frequently distracted by competitors, discomfort, or irrelevant thoughts. Can follow simple pre-race routine most of the time but occasionally forgets or skips steps. Beginning to distinguish between helpful focus (external task cues like relaxation, pacing) and unhelpful focus (internal suffering, outcome worries). Some ability to refocus after distraction but takes significant time and effort. Demonstrates awareness that concentration matters. In training, can focus on technique or workout purpose for portions of session but not throughout. Responds to focus reminders from coaches but doesn't self-regulate consistently. Shows improvement trajectory but concentration remains significant limitation."

      "label": "Competent",
      "description": "Good focus and concentration enabling competent performance. Can maintain attention on performance-relevant cues for extended periods (several minutes). Reasonably resistant to distractions - can stay focused despite moderate external stimuli. During races, maintains primary focus on execution: pacing, technique, race plan, tactical positioning. Follows pre-race routine consistently - provides mental anchor and appropriate focus. Uses primarily external focus (task cues) rather than internal focus (body sensations, pain). Can refocus relatively quickly when concentration breaks - recognizes wandering attention and redirects. Demonstrates good concentration control for club-regional level. In training, maintains appropriate focus throughout sessions - knows purpose and executes accordingly. Can employ basic attention control techniques: process cues, present-moment focus, helpful self-talk. Shows self-awareness about concentration quality and can self-regulate reasonably well. Understands focus directly impacts performance quality."

      "label": "Advanced",
      "description": "Excellent focus and concentration competitive at regional-national level. Maintains attention on performance-relevant cues throughout training and racing with rare lapses. Highly resistant to distractions - can concentrate despite intense external stimuli (crowd noise, weather, competitors) and internal sensations (fatigue, discomfort). During races, focus locked on optimal cues: executing race plan, maintaining technique and relaxation, tactical awareness, pacing discipline. Executes pre-race routine perfectly - provides mental preparation and appropriate attentional focus. Uses sophisticated external focus on task-relevant cues associated with superior performance and lower perceived effort. Refocuses instantly when concentration breaks - automated attention control. Demonstrates superior concentration control. In training, maintains perfect session focus - executes purpose optimally. Uses advanced attention control techniques: mindfulness, attentional flexibility (zooming in and out), selective attention. Self-regulates concentration expertly. Competitive advantage through superior focus - can concentrate when others cannot. Serves as model for concentration excellence."

      "label": "Elite",
      "description": "World-class focus and concentration among the best globally. Maintains perfect attention on performance-relevant cues throughout Olympic and World Championship competitions regardless of distractions or pressure. Exceptional resistance to all distractions - concentrates flawlessly despite massive crowds, media attention, championship pressure, extreme weather, or tactical complexity. During championship finals, focus locked perfectly on execution while maintaining tactical awareness and adaptability. Pre-race routine mastered through years - provides optimal mental state and attentional focus. Uses elite-level external focus on task cues enabling peak performance and minimal perceived effort even at world-class intensities. Attention control automatic - refocusing instantaneous when rare lapses occur. Demonstrates championship-level concentration control. In all training, focus perfect regardless of conditions or circumstances. Masters advanced mental skills: meditation, mindfulness, attentional control, flow states. Concentration never wavers even under maximum pressure or in multi-round championship formats. Among the best globally at maintaining performance focus. Serves as international model for concentration excellence. Wins championships partly through superior concentration when mental demands are highest."

  "assessmentGuidance": "Assess through observation and discussion during training and competition. Observe attention patterns: what does athlete focus on before, during, and after efforts? Note distraction resistance: can athlete maintain focus despite external stimuli (noise, weather, other athletes) and internal sensations (fatigue, discomfort)? Discuss post-performance: what was athlete thinking about during race or workout? Was focus on helpful cues (technique, pacing, race plan) or unhelpful (pain, competitors, outcome worries)? Evaluate pre-performance routine consistency - provides window into concentration patterns. Track focus quality across competition importance - does concentration hold in biggest moments or crack under pressure? Use attention control assessments or mindfulness measures if available. Note whether athlete uses external focus (task cues) versus internal focus (body sensations). Observe refocusing speed after distractions. Remember concentration is trainable through specific mental skills work including mindfulness, attention control exercises, and deliberate practice with performance cues."
