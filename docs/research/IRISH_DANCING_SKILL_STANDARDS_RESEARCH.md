# Irish Dancing Skill Standards Research

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive research document examines Irish dancing skill standards, assessment criteria, and competitive structures as defined by the world's governing bodies, primarily An Coimisiún Le Rincí Gaelacha (CLRG). Irish dancing is a highly technical art form characterized by rapid, precise footwork, upright posture with minimal upper body movement, and a systematic progression from beginner through championship levels. The competitive structure includes both grade levels (Beginner, Advanced Beginner, Novice, Prizewinner) and championship levels (Preliminary Championship, Open Championship), with dancers advancing based on competitive placements and demonstrated technical proficiency.

This research identifies 25 key technical skills across five domains: Posture & Carriage, Footwork & Technique, Movement Quality, Performance, and Hard Shoe Technique. Each skill has been analyzed for development progressions from beginner through elite levels, with age-appropriate benchmarks from Under 6 through adult categories. The document provides sufficient detail to support the creation of multi-level skill descriptors aligned with both competitive levels and age groups.

Key findings include:
- Competition structure with 6 progressive levels requiring specific placements for advancement
- Age group categories from Under 6 through Adult (18+), with age determined as of January 1st each year
- 25 distinct technical skills assessed in competition and grade examinations
- Standardized music tempos for each dance type (Reel, Light Jig, Slip Jig, Hornpipe, Treble Jig, Traditional Sets)
- Comprehensive adjudication system requiring 5+ years teaching experience and 2-year training program
- Grade examination system (Preliminary through Grade 12) providing structured non-competitive assessment

## Governing Bodies and Competition Structure

### Primary Governing Body: An Coimisiún Le Rincí Gaelacha (CLRG)

An Coimisiún Le Rincí Gaelacha (The Irish Dancing Commission), established in 1929, is the largest and oldest governing body of Irish dancing worldwide. CLRG sets the standards for Irish dancing through examinations and championship events, serving as the primary international authority for competitive Irish dance.

**Key Functions:**
- Certifying Irish dance teachers (TCRG - Teagascóir Choimisiúin Le Rincí Gaelacha)
- Certifying adjudicators (ADCRG - Adjudicator)
- Establishing competition rules and standards
- Organizing major championships including All Ireland Championships (Oireachtas Rince na hÉireann) and World Championships (Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne)
- Publishing official syllabi and rule books
- Maintaining grade examination system

**2026 Major Championships:**
- All Ireland Championships: February 15-21, 2026 (Gleneagle INEC, Killarney, County Kerry)
- World Championships: March 29 - April 5, 2026 (Renaissance Schaumburg Convention Center)

### Alternative Organization: An Comhdháil

An Comhdháil was founded in 1969 as an alternative to CLRG due to disagreements over competition rules and organizational governance. While smaller than CLRG, it remains internationally recognized and operates similar competitive structures with some differences in:
- Competition rules and judging criteria
- Costume regulations
- Music requirements and tempo standards
- Organizational structure and governance
- Fee structures

**Important Note:** Dancers registered with one organization typically cannot compete in the other's competitions, requiring families to choose one affiliation based on local teacher availability and preference.

### World Irish Dance Association (WIDA)

A third governing body offering alternative certification paths, grade examinations, and competition structures. WIDA operates independently with its own syllabus and adjudication standards.

## Skill Taxonomy: 25 Key Technical Skills

This section identifies and describes the 25 core technical skills assessed in Irish dancing, organized into five domains. Each skill is fundamental to Irish dance technique and is evaluated in both competitive and examination contexts.

### Domain 1: Posture & Carriage

#### 1. Upper Body Control and Stillness

**Definition:** The ability to maintain a rigid, motionless upper torso while performing rapid lower body movements.

**Key Elements:**
- Torso remains lifted and quiet
- Minimal movement above the waist
- Core engagement to stabilize upper body
- Characteristic signature of Irish dance style

**Assessment Focus:**
- Degree of upper body stillness during complex footwork
- Consistency of control throughout routine
- Ability to maintain stillness during jumps and turns

**Importance:**
Upright carriage with quiet upper body is a stylistic and pedagogical choice that became standard in competition instruction. This distinctive characteristic sets Irish dancing apart from other dance forms and requires exceptional core control.

#### 2. Head Position and Carriage

**Definition:** Proper alignment and positioning of the head, maintaining an evenly balanced position atop a relaxed neck.

**Key Elements:**
- Chin level (neither lifted nor dropped)
- Eyes forward and engaged
- Head evenly balanced
- Neck relaxed yet aligned with upper back

**Assessment Focus:**
- Maintenance of level chin throughout routine
- Forward gaze (not looking down at feet)
- Alignment with spine
- Confidence projected through head position

**Importance:**
The neck should remain in line with the upper back for good alignment and postural development. Proper head position contributes to overall elegance and professional presentation.

#### 3. Arm Placement and Control

**Definition:** The ability to maintain proper arm position with arms straight at the sides throughout the dance.

**Key Elements:**
- Arms held straight and close to sides
- Minimal to no arm movement
- Relaxed shoulders (not tensed)
- Consistent position maintained during all movements

**Assessment Focus:**
- Stillness of arms during complex footwork
- Proximity to body
- Consistency throughout routine
- Lack of compensatory arm swing

**Challenges:**
Dancers with limited hip mobility often compensate by twisting hips or waist, causing arms to wiggle side to side. Proper arm control requires adequate hip mobility for crossing movements.

**Historical Context:**
Upright carriage and quiet arms became standard in competition instruction and are deeply rooted in the dance-master tradition and early 20th century codifications.

#### 4. Back Posture and Alignment

**Definition:** Maintaining optimal spinal alignment from neck to tailbone throughout the dance.

**Key Elements:**
- Spine in neutral alignment (all natural curves present and properly aligned)
- Cervical/neck curve maintained
- Thoracic/midback alignment
- Lumbar/low back positioning
- Straight back without slouching
- No leaning forward or backward

**Assessment Focus:**
- Maintenance of spinal curves
- Avoidance of collapsed or hyperextended positions
- Consistency of alignment during jumps and turns
- Overall postural integrity

**Importance:**
Core elements include keeping the back straight from neck to tailbone. Dancers should strive to maintain confident posture with spine in neutral alignment, which is essential for both technical execution and injury prevention.

#### 5. Shoulder Position and Relaxation

**Definition:** Proper positioning of shoulders - back and down - while maintaining relaxation.

**Key Elements:**
- Shoulders open (down and back)
- Chest lifted
- Avoidance of shoulders rising toward ears
- Relaxation despite maintained position

**Assessment Focus:**
- Shoulders remain down and back throughout routine
- Lack of tension in shoulder area
- Contribution to overall elegant carriage
- Consistency during challenging movements

**Benefits:**
Keeping shoulders back adds to proper posture in Irish dancing, creating an elegant and upright stance. When shoulders are back, the chest lifts, and the back straightens, which allows the dancer to engage core muscles and maintain a strong, stable center of balance.

### Domain 2: Footwork & Technique

#### 6. Toe Point and Foot Articulation

**Definition:** The ability to fully point the toes and articulate through the foot in all movements.

**Key Elements:**
- Toe pointed every time foot lifts off ground
- Full extension through the foot
- Big toe mobility for final push
- Articulation from ankle through toes

**Technical Standard:**
"A really great Irish dancer points her toe every time she lifts it off the ground, kicks her butt, or leaps through the air."

**Assessment Focus:**
- Consistency of toe pointing in all movements
- Degree of foot extension
- Quality of line created
- Articulation through all positions

**Biomechanics:**
The final push onto the tips of toes comes largely from the big toe joint. If this joint is stiff or restricted, it becomes physically impossible to achieve full extension through the foot.

**Importance:**
Toe pointing is one of the most fundamental and visible technical elements in Irish dancing, contributing significantly to the overall aesthetic quality.

#### 7. Turnout (External Hip Rotation)

**Definition:** External rotation of the legs from the hips, creating the characteristic turned-out foot position.

**Key Elements:**
- Rotation originates from the hips (not feet or knees)
- When properly turned out, a diamond-shaped space appears between legs and ankles
- Consistent turnout maintained throughout all movements
- Particularly emphasized in soft shoe dancing

**Assessment Focus:**
- Degree of hip external rotation
- Maintenance of turnout during complex movements
- Contribution to crossing and knee placement
- Aesthetic line created

**Biomechanical Requirements:**
In order to turn feet out, the hips must be able to externally rotate well. If hips are tight or lacking mobility, dancers will struggle with proper turnout.

**Importance:**
Turnout is a key component of Irish dance technique, contributing to elegance and grace, particularly in soft shoe dances like reel and slip jig where precise foot placement and turnout are essential.

#### 8. Elevation and Height on Toes

**Definition:** The ability to maintain maximum height on the balls of the feet and toes throughout the dance.

**Key Elements:**
- Dancing as high on toes as possible
- High relevé in both soft and hard shoe
- Avoidance of flat-footed positioning
- Maintenance of height throughout routine

**Technical Standard:**
"Irish dancers should be as high on their toes as possible, in soft AND hard shoe."

**Assessment Focus:**
- Consistent height maintenance
- Quality of relevé
- Avoidance of dropping heels
- Contribution to lightness and precision

**Benefits:**
Staying high on toes helps create a light and precise quality of movement, enabling dancers to execute steps with speed and agility.

**Historical Context:**
An Ulster style incorporated balletic movements and high elevation on the toes, gradually superseding the Munster style with fast, low footwork which had prevailed up to that point.

#### 9. Weight Placement and Balance

**Definition:** Proper distribution and transfer of weight for optimal balance and control.

**Key Elements:**
- Neutral foot alignment (avoiding pronation/rolling in)
- Weight appropriately distributed over ball of foot
- Smooth weight transfers
- Controlled balance during all positions

**Assessment Focus:**
- Quality of balance in static and dynamic positions
- Control during weight transfers
- Avoidance of pronation (rolling inward on foot)
- Stability during complex movements

**Biomechanical Considerations:**
Pronation (rolling in on the foot, placing most weight on the inside of the foot) should be avoided. Dancers should practice with feet in neutral alignment to reduce risk of foot and ankle injury.

**Technique:**
Proper travel technique involves taking light, springy steps and transferring weight smoothly from one foot to the other, maintaining balance and control.

#### 10. Footwork Speed and Accuracy

**Definition:** The ability to execute rapid, precise foot movements with correct timing and placement.

**Key Elements:**
- Rapid execution of complex footwork
- Precise placement of each step
- Accurate timing
- Clean execution without blur or imprecision

**Assessment Focus:**
- Speed of execution
- Precision and clarity of each movement
- Accuracy of rhythmic patterns
- Maintenance of technique at high speeds

**Technical Standards:**
"Traditional Irish dancing directs all attention to the speed and accuracy of the footwork. Irish dance is characterized by rapid foot movements, precise steps, and an upright body posture. It requires precision, endurance, and strength, with dancers executing rapid, complex foot movements while maintaining an upright posture."

**Importance:**
Precision is at the heart of Irish step dancing; every movement, every step, and every gesture must be executed with utmost accuracy. The complexity and precision of the footwork often define a dancer's skill level.

#### 11. Precision and Clarity of Steps

**Definition:** The execution of steps with exact placement, clean lines, and clear definition.

**Key Elements:**
- Exact placement of feet
- Clear definition between movements
- Crisp execution without blur
- Attention to detail in every step

**Assessment Focus:**
- Clarity of individual movements
- Sharpness of execution
- Avoidance of muddy or unclear steps
- Consistency of precision throughout routine

**Technical Emphasis:**
"Precision and clarity of steps requires attention to the placement and timing of footwork to ensure clean and crisp movements."

**Training Approach:**
Footwork requires precision and coordination, starting with basic steps such as reel or jig with slow and deliberate movements to ensure accuracy. Dancers must focus on proper technique, as proper technique will help execute steps correctly and more efficiently.

#### 12. Crossing at the Knees

**Definition:** The ability to maintain crossed legs with one knee hiding behind the other throughout movements.

**Key Elements:**
- One knee consistently in front of the other
- "Kissing knees" - knees touch when switching positions
- The "over-crossed" look of hiding the back knee
- Diamond-shaped space visible between legs and ankles when properly turned out

**Assessment Focus:**
- Consistency of knee crossing
- Degree of "over-crossing"
- Smoothness of transitions when front leg switches
- Contribution to characteristic Irish dance aesthetic

**Technical Challenge:**
Keeping knees crossed is considered one of the hardest techniques to master in Irish dance, requiring significant hip mobility.

**Biomechanics:**
To fully cross knees over each other, dancers need improved hip mobility, specifically lateral hip muscles. Think about crossing thighs over to achieve proper crossing.

**Importance:**
The "over-crossed" look is unique to Irish dance and often sets top dancers apart from the competition. Crossing at the knee allows dancers to maintain tight and controlled lower body for quick footwork and is a critical component of judging criteria.

### Domain 3: Movement Quality

#### 13. Lightness and Spring

**Definition:** The quality of movement that appears effortless, light, and buoyant.

**Key Elements:**
- Light quality in all movements
- Spring in the knees (not locked)
- Appearance of floating or flying
- Effortless execution despite high difficulty

**Technical Approach:**
Staying high on toes (or toe blocks in hard shoe) as much as possible, especially in soft shoe dances, through relevé gives lightness, elegance, and clarity to dancing.

**Assessment Focus:**
- Visual impression of lightness
- Lack of heavy or plodding quality
- Buoyancy in movements
- Illusion of effortlessness

**Training:**
Dancers should maintain lightness in knees by not locking joints and letting some spring. Proper technique is the key to mastering lightness in feet and the illusion of flight when leaping.

#### 14. Jump Height and Elevation

**Definition:** The ability to achieve maximum height in jumps and aerial movements.

**Key Elements:**
- Maximum vertical height achieved
- Consistent elevation throughout routine
- Power in takeoff
- Control in landing

**Assessment Focus:**
- Height achieved relative to dancer's ability
- Consistency of jump height
- Power and explosiveness
- Maintenance of technique in the air

**Competitive Context:**
Lift and elevation in competitive choreography often includes high jumps and tight landings that project power without losing alignment.

**Training Requirements:**
Building strength for jumping requires balance, strength through the foot, ankle, and leg, as launch and landing mechanics develop as dancers progress. Building up strength in the feet, ankles, and major muscles groups of the legs is key.

#### 15. Landing Control and Safety

**Definition:** The ability to land from jumps with proper technique, control, and safety.

**Key Elements:**
- Landing on balls of feet (never flat)
- Controlled deceleration
- Maintenance of alignment
- Heels never lowering throughout movements

**Assessment Focus:**
- Quality of landing technique
- Control and softness
- Proper foot placement
- Maintenance of posture through landing

**Safety Considerations:**
The force of landing a big jump incorrectly can lead to a host of foot, ankle, knee, shin, hip, and back injuries. Proper landing technique is essential for both performance quality and injury prevention.

**Challenge:**
Because Irish dance restricts upper body movement, movement patterns lack the counter balance that the upper body provides in almost all other activities, making landing control more challenging.

#### 16. Rhythm and Timing

**Definition:** The ability to maintain precise timing with the music and execute rhythmic patterns accurately.

**Key Elements:**
- Exact synchronization with music
- Accurate execution of rhythmic patterns
- Maintenance of tempo throughout routine
- Understanding of different time signatures (4/4, 6/8, 9/8)

**Assessment Focus:**
- Precision of timing
- Synchronization with music
- Accuracy of rhythmic patterns
- Recovery if timing is lost

**Critical Importance:**
In Irish dance competitions, timing and rhythm are considered critical elements, with a "late start" being particularly serious and potentially placing a dancer in last place even if everything else was excellent.

**Standard:**
Understanding the importance of timing and rhythm is crucial in achieving a seamless and captivating Irish dance performance, requiring dancers to possess a strong sense of musicality and be able to find the right rhythm within the music.

#### 17. Musicality

**Definition:** The ability to interpret and express the character of the music through dance, beyond mere technical accuracy.

**Key Elements:**
- Interpretation of musical character
- Dance style matching the specific dance type
- Expression of the music's mood and feeling
- Nuanced response to musical phrasing

**Assessment Focus:**
- Appropriateness of style to dance type
- Musical interpretation
- Variation in quality between different dances
- Demonstration of understanding beyond basic timing

**Judging Standard:**
"Dancers who dance all their soft shoe dances with the same style will score well in those which fit that style but not so well in the others - this is what constitutes 'musicality.'"

**Importance:**
Musicality separates technically proficient dancers from artistic performers, demonstrating deep understanding of Irish dance music traditions and appropriate interpretation of each dance type.

#### 18. Flow and Continuity

**Definition:** The seamless connection of movements creating continuous, fluid performance.

**Key Elements:**
- Smooth transitions between steps
- Continuous rhythmic patterns
- Seamless connections in choreography
- Maintenance of flow during complex sequences

**Assessment Focus:**
- Quality of transitions
- Absence of breaks or pauses
- Maintenance of continuous movement quality

- Maintenance of technique as routine progresses
- Sustained energy from start to finish
- Recovery between dances
- Physical conditioning for demands of competition

**Physical Demands:**
Irish dancing involves performing at high intensity for an average of 40-60 seconds, with dancers needing to perform anaerobically for up to 3 minutes. Irish dance is more like a sprint - using extremely high amounts of energy over a relatively short amount of time.

**Energy Systems:**
The anaerobic system is key to stamina in Irish dance. Unlike marathon-style endurance training, Irish dance is a mix of anaerobic and aerobic energy systems that demands short bursts of high effort, not long steady cardio.

**Fitness Requirements:**
- Explosive power for jumps
- Core stability for balance
- Cardiovascular endurance for prolonged routines
- Speed, power, height, posture, flexibility
- Lactic acid tolerance

**Training Recommendations:**
- Plyometric or sprinting-style exercises (squat jumps, bike sprints)
- Tabata training (4 exercises for 20 seconds with 10-second rest, repeated twice)
- Strength training 2-3x/week focusing on legs, core, glutes, and balance
- Balance of dance practice and cross-training

**Importance:**
Strong dancers last longer and dance better. Traditional long-distance cardio is less effective than high-intensity interval training that mimics the explosive, sprint-like nature of Irish dancing.

### Domain 5: Hard Shoe Technique

#### 23. Trebles and Toe Technique

**Definition:** The execution of toe strikes (trebles) in hard shoe dancing, creating percussive sounds.

- Quality of execution

**Sound Quality:**
The sound should be clear - don't rush. Make sure weight is well balanced so stamps or taps are crisp. Often the clarity of "click" or "stamp" depends on precision of contact.

**Technical Balance:**
Trebles, stamps, and heel clicks form a percussion layer that matches hornpipes and reels. Dancers learn to balance volume with clarity so the pattern reads musically.

#### 24. Stamps and Heel Clicks

**Definition:** The execution of full-foot stamps and heel-click combinations in hard shoe dancing.

**Equipment Considerations:**
Molded heels and toe tips ensure consistent sound and performance with every step. Lightweight design ensures sharper, crisper clicks and taps.

**Regional Styles:**
The style practiced in Munster saw dancers on balls of feet, using intricate percussive techniques to create complex rhythm. A tradition developed in Ulster saw dancers instead using heel to create persistent drumming effect.

#### 25. Rhythmic Drumming and Sound Quality

**Definition:** The overall quality and musicality of sounds produced in hard shoe dancing.

**Key Elements:**
- Musical quality of percussion
- Rhythmic patterns clearly executed
- Balance of volume and clarity
- Variety in sound production

**Assessment Focus:**
- Musical quality of hard shoe work
