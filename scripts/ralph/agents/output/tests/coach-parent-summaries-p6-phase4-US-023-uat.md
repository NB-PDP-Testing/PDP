# UAT Test: US-023 - Add daily aggregation for AI usage stats

> Auto-generated: 2026-01-25 20:30
> Status: ⏳ Pending Execution

## Story
As the system, I pre-aggregate daily AI usage stats for faster dashboard queries

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Add aiUsageDailyAggregates table to schema.ts: date (string YYYY-MM-DD), organizationId (string), totalCost (number), totalCalls (number), totalInputTokens (number), totalCachedTokens (number), totalOutputTokens (number), avgCacheHitRate (number)
- [ ] Add indexes: by_date (date), by_org_date (organizationId, date)
- [ ] Edit crons.ts: Add cron job aggregateDailyUsage (runs daily at 1 AM UTC)
- [ ] Job queries previous day's aiUsageLog entries, groups by organizationId, aggregates stats, inserts into aiUsageDailyAggregates
- [ ] Update getOrgUsage query (or create new variant): For date ranges > 7 days, query aggregates table instead of raw logs (performance optimization)
- [ ] Keep raw logs for detailed analysis, aggregates for dashboard speed
- [ ] Typecheck passes
