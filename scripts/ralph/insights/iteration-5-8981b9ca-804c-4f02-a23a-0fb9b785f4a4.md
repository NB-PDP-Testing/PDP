## Patterns Discovered
- Let me read the progress.txt file in chunks, starting with the Codebase Patterns section:
- Let me check how it was done in parent-summary-card.tsx to follow the same pattern:
- Perfect! Now I understand the pattern. Let me update the parent-summaries-section.tsx file to use relative date formatting. I need to:

## Gotchas & Learnings
- Good, the formatting issue is fixed. The warnings are pre-existing. Now let me commit again:
- Now let me check US-017 and US-018 acceptance criteria more carefully. Most work is already done, but let me verify and make any necessary additions. Since I'm at 91K tokens (45.8%), I have plenty of room to complete these and then do final testing.
- - **Linting**: All modified files pass (pre-existing warnings in unrelated files)
