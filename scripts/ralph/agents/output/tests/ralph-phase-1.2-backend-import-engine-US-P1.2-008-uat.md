## Story
As the import system, I need to pass a sport code to the import mutation instead of hardcoding 'gaa_football'.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Add optional arg: sportCode: v.optional(v.string()) to batchImportPlayersWithIdentity
- [ ] Replace all hardcoded 'gaa_football' references with: args.sportCode || 'gaa_football'
- [ ] DO NOT modify the guardian matching algorithm
- [ ] Existing imports work identically when sportCode is not provided
- [ ] Typecheck passes: npm run check-types
