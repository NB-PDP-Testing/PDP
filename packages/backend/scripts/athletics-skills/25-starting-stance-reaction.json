  "description": "Execution of standing or rolling start for events not using blocks: 800m (stagger start), 1500m and longer distances, and relay legs 2-4. Proper acceleration mechanics from standing or rolling start without false starting. 3-point or 4-point stance for some applications. Quick reaction to gun while maintaining legal start (not anticipating). Used in waterfall starts (mass starts) and races where blocks not permitted. Different technical demands than block starts but equally important for race success.",

      "description": "Poor standing start technique and reactions. Starting position random and uncomfortable - poor weight distribution, unstable stance. Reaction to gun very slow - processes command late and begins movement well after competitors. Or conversely, may false start frequently through poor anticipation and gun discipline. Acceleration from standing start weak and slow - takes excessive time to reach target pace. No understanding of proper stance for different events (800m versus 1500m+ versus relay exchange). Body position poor at gun - may be too upright or leaning wrong direction. Cannot maintain balance when leaning forward in set position. In relay exchanges (standing start for incoming position), timing completely off with partner. Demonstrates no understanding of standing start mechanics or strategy. Loses significant ground in first 50-100m through poor start execution. Cannot execute consistent starts across attempts."

      "label": "Emerging",
      "description": "Basic standing start ability developing but inconsistent. Starting position improving - better weight distribution and stance stability. Reaction time moderate - not exceptionally slow but not competitive at higher levels. Fewer false starts as gun discipline improves but still occasional early movements. Acceleration from standing start moderate - can reach race pace within reasonable time but not optimally quick. Learning appropriate stances for different events but application inconsistent. Body position at gun better though not optimal - may still be too upright or have suboptimal lean. Can maintain balance in forward-leaning set position most of the time. In relay exchanges, timing with partner improving but not reliable. Responds to coaching on start technique but needs frequent reminders. Shows improvement trajectory. Can execute acceptable starts in training but struggles under competition pressure. Demonstrates awareness of proper technique but inconsistent execution."

      "label": "Competent",
      "description": "Good standing start technique enabling competent race beginnings. Starting position sound - good weight distribution, stable stance appropriate for event. Reaction time reasonable (0.20-0.25 seconds typically) competitive at club-regional level. Rare false starts, good gun discipline and mental control. Acceleration from standing start effective - reaches race pace efficiently without excessive time or distance. Uses appropriate stance for event: aggressive forward lean for 800m stagger start, upright for distance races, proper position for relay exchanges. Body position at gun good - proper lean angle for event demands. Maintains perfect balance in set position. In relay exchanges, good timing with regular partners. Can self-correct if start feels off. Competitive starting ability for level. Demonstrates solid understanding of standing start mechanics and event-specific requirements. Minimal disadvantage in starts compared to competitors."

      "label": "Advanced",
      "description": "Excellent standing start technique competitive at regional-national level. Starting position optimal - perfect weight distribution, rock-solid stance. Quick reaction time (0.17-0.20 seconds) creating advantage over slower reactors. Virtually no false starts despite aggressive positioning - perfect gun discipline. Rapid acceleration from standing start - reaches race pace very quickly gaining early advantage. Perfect stance selection for all events and situations. Body position at gun biomechanically optimal for demands. Perfect balance in all set positions. In relay exchanges, timing with all partners excellent, quick adjustment to new teammates. Can demonstrate perfect technique and explain mechanics and strategy. Competitive advantage through superior starting ability. Frequently gains positions in first 100-200m through excellent starts. Serves as model for standing start technique. Can teach event-specific starting strategies effectively."

      "label": "Elite",
      "description": "World-class standing start technique among the best globally. Starting position biomechanically perfect for event demands. Exceptionally quick reaction time (0.15-0.18 seconds) while maintaining legal starts - among fastest reactors globally. Perfect gun discipline despite racing on edge of legal reaction time. Explosive acceleration from standing start - reaches world-class race pace in minimal time and distance. Demonstrates perfect stance execution across all events and situations. Body position at gun optimized through years of refinement. Perfect balance and control in all starting positions. In relay exchanges, timing perfection with teammates. Competitive advantage decisive through superior starting ability - frequently gains significant early position advantage. Demonstrates championship-level technique during Olympic or World Championship finals. Serves as international model for standing start mechanics. Among the best starters globally in non-block events. No technical flaws observable under any circumstance including major championship mass starts."

  "assessmentGuidance": "Observe starting position: weight distribution, stance stability, body angle appropriate for event. Measure or estimate reaction time from gun to first movement. Count false starts and near-false starts (moving just before gun). Watch acceleration from start: time and distance to reach race pace. Note stance appropriateness: 800m should show more aggressive forward lean, 1500m+ more upright, relay exchanges proper receiving position. Assess balance in set position - can athlete hold forward lean without falling? In relay exchanges, observe timing with partner. Video analysis helpful for detailed review of starting mechanics. Compare positions gained or lost in first 100-200m relative to competitors. Evaluate consistency across multiple starts. This skill applies to all events not using starting blocks (800m+, relays legs 2-4)."
