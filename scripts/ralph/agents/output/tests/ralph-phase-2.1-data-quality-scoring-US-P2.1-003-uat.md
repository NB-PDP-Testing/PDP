## Story
As an admin reviewing import data, I need a visual report showing the quality score, dimension breakdown, and actionable issues.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Create apps/web/src/components/import/data-quality-report.tsx
- [ ] Overall score display: large number (0-100), grade badge (Excellent/Good/Fair/Poor/Critical), color-coded (green/yellow/orange/red)
- [ ] 5 dimension progress bars: Completeness, Consistency, Accuracy, Uniqueness, Timeliness — each with score and label
- [ ] Issue breakdown sections: Critical (red), Warnings (amber), Suggestions (blue) — with count badges
- [ ] Each issue section is collapsible (use shadcn/ui Collapsible or Accordion)
- [ ] Each issue row shows: row number, field name, message, suggested fix (if available), and Apply Fix button
- [ ] Apply Fix button calls onFixIssue callback prop — parent handles the actual data mutation
- [ ] Continue button disabled when critical issues exist (count > 0)
- [ ] Use shadcn/ui Card, Progress, Badge, Button, Collapsible, Alert components
- [ ] Mobile responsive: stacked layout at 375px
- [ ] Component accepts props: qualityReport, onFixIssue, onContinue, onBack
