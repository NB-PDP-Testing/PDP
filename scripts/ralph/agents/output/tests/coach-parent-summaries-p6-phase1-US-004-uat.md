> Auto-generated: 2026-01-25 12:29
> Status: ⏳ Pending Execution

## Story
As the system, budget checks prevent overspending.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Edit processVoiceNoteInsight action in actions/coachParentSummaries.ts
- [ ] FIRST STEP (before any AI calls): Run const budgetCheck = await ctx.runQuery(api.models.orgCostBudgets.checkOrgCostBudget, { organizationId })
- [ ] If !budgetCheck.withinBudget: log warning, call logBudgetExceededEvent mutation, return early WITHOUT calling classifyInsightSensitivity or generateParentSummary (skip all AI)
- [ ] Create internal mutation: logBudgetExceededEvent with args: organizationId, reason
- [ ] Call logBudgetExceededEvent so we track how often this happens (analytics)
- [ ] Return helpful error message with resetAt time so coach knows when budget resets
- [ ] Typecheck passes
