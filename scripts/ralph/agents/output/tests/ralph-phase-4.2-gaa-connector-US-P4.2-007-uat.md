## Story
As a developer, I need test utilities and mock data to validate GAA connector functionality without hitting the real Foireann API.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Create packages/backend/convex/lib/federation/gaaTestData.ts
- [ ] Export mockGAAMembers array with 10+ realistic test members
- [ ] Include variety: valid members, missing email, invalid phone, malformed address, lapsed membership
- [ ] Export mockGAAMembershipListResponse: paginated API response format
- [ ] Export mockGAAMemberDetailResponse: detailed member API response
- [ ] Create mockFoireannClient: mock implementation of FederationApiClient for testing
- [ ] mockFoireannClient returns test data instead of making real API calls
- [ ] Add test mutation: testGAASync({ useMockData: boolean }) to run sync with mock or real API
- [ ] Add validation test: validateGAAFieldMapping() to verify all field transformations
- [ ] Add duplicate detection test: testGAADeduplication() with known duplicates
- [ ] Run npx ultracite fix
