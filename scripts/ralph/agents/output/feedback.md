# Pre-Implementation Review -- Phase 2.4: Granular Undo

**Date:** 2026-02-13
**Reviewer:** Architecture Reviewer Agent
**Status:** NO-GO until pre-conditions resolved (4 critical blockers)

---

## 1. Context File Verification

| # | File | Exists | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | `packages/backend/convex/models/importSessions.ts` | YES | 320 lines, no auth checks |
| 2 | `packages/backend/convex/models/playerImport.ts` | YES | 1128 lines |
| 3 | `packages/backend/convex/schema.ts` | YES | ~4700+ lines |
| 4 | `apps/web/src/components/import/import-wizard.tsx` | YES | WizardState type confirmed |
| 5 | `apps/web/src/components/import/steps/complete-step.tsx` | YES | 231 lines |
| 6 | `apps/web/src/app/orgs/[orgId]/import/page.tsx` | YES | 676 lines |
| 7 | `CLAUDE.md` | YES | |

**Result:** 7/7 context files verified.

---

## 2. Index Verification: by_importSessionId on 6 Tables

This is the **most critical** check. The entire undo feature depends on querying 6 tables by `importSessionId`.

| # | Table | Has `importSessionId` field? | Has `by_importSessionId` index? | Status |
|---|-------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------|
| 1 | `playerIdentities` | YES (line 279) | **NO** | CRITICAL BLOCKER |
| 2 | `guardianIdentities` | **NO** | **NO** | CRITICAL BLOCKER |
| 3 | `guardianPlayerLinks` | **NO** | **NO** | CRITICAL BLOCKER |
| 4 | `orgPlayerEnrollments` | YES (line 440) | **NO** | CRITICAL BLOCKER |
| 5 | `sportPassports` | **NO** | **NO** | CRITICAL BLOCKER |
| 6 | `skillAssessments` | **NO** | **NO** | CRITICAL BLOCKER |

### Detailed Findings

- **playerIdentities** (schema line 242-290): Has `importSessionId: v.optional(v.id("importSessions"))` at line 279. The field is populated during batch import at `playerImport.ts` line 675. But there is NO `by_importSessionId` index -- only `by_name_dob`, `by_userId`, `by_email`, `by_playerType`.

- **guardianIdentities** (schema line 166-208): No `importSessionId` field at all. Has `createdFrom: v.optional(v.string())` but no session tracking. Indexes: `by_email`, `by_userId`, `by_phone`, `by_postcode`, `by_name`.

- **guardianPlayerLinks** (schema line 339-401): No `importSessionId` field. No way to trace back to the import session. Indexes: `by_guardian`, `by_player`, `by_guardian_and_player`, `by_guardian_and_status`, `by_status`.

- **orgPlayerEnrollments** (schema line 403-458): Has `importSessionId: v.optional(v.id("importSessions"))` at line 440. Populated during batch import at `playerImport.ts` line 1036. But NO `by_importSessionId` index.

- **sportPassports** (schema line 498-560): No `importSessionId` field. Created during import at `playerImport.ts` line 1057-1068 but with no session tracking. Indexes: `by_playerIdentityId`, `by_player_and_sport`, `by_player_and_org`, `by_organizationId`, etc.

- **skillAssessments** (schema line 562-643): No `importSessionId` field. Created during import via `benchmarkApplicator.ts` line 166 with `assessmentType: "import"` but no session ID. Indexes: `by_passportId`, `by_playerIdentityId`, `by_player_and_sport`, etc.

### Import Traceability Gap

The `batchImportPlayersWithIdentity` mutation in `playerImport.ts` only sets `importSessionId` on 2 of the 6 tables:
- `playerIdentities` (line 675): `importSessionId: args.sessionId`
- `orgPlayerEnrollments` (line 1036): `importSessionId: args.sessionId`

The other 4 tables (`guardianIdentities`, `guardianPlayerLinks`, `sportPassports`, `skillAssessments`) are created without any import session tracking.

---

## 3. Pre-Conditions / Blockers

### CRITICAL (Must fix before implementation)

**C1: Add `importSessionId` field to 4 tables in schema.ts**

Add `importSessionId: v.optional(v.id("importSessions"))` to:
- `guardianIdentities` (after line 202, before `createdAt`)
- `guardianPlayerLinks` (after line 394, before `createdAt`)
- `sportPassports` (after line 547, before `createdAt`)
- `skillAssessments` (after line 633, before `createdAt`)

**C2: Add `by_importSessionId` index to ALL 6 tables in schema.ts**

Add `.index("by_importSessionId", ["importSessionId"])` to:
- `playerIdentities` (after line 290)
- `guardianIdentities` (after line 208)
- `guardianPlayerLinks` (after line 401)
- `orgPlayerEnrollments` (after line 458)
- `sportPassports` (after line 560)
- `skillAssessments` (after line 643)

**C3: Set `importSessionId` on all 6 tables during import**

Update `batchImportPlayersWithIdentity` in `playerImport.ts` to pass `importSessionId: args.sessionId` when inserting:
- `guardianIdentities` (lines 799-812 and 936-949)
- `guardianPlayerLinks` (lines 844-854 and 974-984)
- `sportPassports` (lines 1057-1068)

Update `benchmarkApplicator.ts` to accept and pass `importSessionId`:
- `skillAssessments` (line 166-179) -- the `applyBenchmarksToPassport` function needs a new `importSessionId` parameter

**C4: Add `"undone"` status and undo fields to importSessions**

In `schema.ts` at line 4626-4634, add `v.literal("undone")` to the status union.

Add fields after `completedAt` (line 4707):
```typescript
undoneAt: v.optional(v.number()),
undoneBy: v.optional(v.string()),
undoReason: v.optional(v.string()),
```

In `importSessions.ts` line 102, update:
```typescript
completed: ["undone"],
```

Also update `statusValidator` at line 11-19 of `importSessions.ts` to include `v.literal("undone")`.

Also update `sessionReturnValidator` to include the new fields.

### WARNINGS

**W1: No auth checks on existing import mutations**

All mutations in `importSessions.ts` have NO authentication checks. The `createImportSession`, `updateSessionStatus`, `updateSessionMappings`, etc. are all unauthenticated. The new `undoImport` and `checkUndoEligibility` MUST use `authComponent.getAuthUser(ctx)` following the pattern in `importSessionDrafts.ts` line 66-69. Consider backfilling auth on existing mutations too, but that is out of scope for Phase 2.4.

**W2: `listSessionsByOrg` sorts in memory**

The existing `listSessionsByOrg` query at line 317 sorts `sessions.sort((a, b) => b.startedAt - a.startedAt)` in memory after collecting all results. For the history page (US-P2.4-003), this is fine for small datasets but could be slow for orgs with many imports. Consider adding a `by_org_and_startedAt` composite index: `.index("by_org_and_startedAt", ["organizationId", "startedAt"])` to enable Convex-level ordering (use `.order("desc")`).

**W3: `complete-step.tsx` does not have access to `sessionId`**

The `CompleteStepProps` type (line 30-33) receives only `organizationId` and `importResult`. It does NOT receive `sessionId`. To add an undo link on the complete step (US-P2.4-005), the `sessionId` needs to be threaded through from `WizardState.sessionId` as a new prop.

---

## 4. Implementation Guidelines Per Story

### US-P2.4-001: checkUndoEligibility Query

**File:** `packages/backend/convex/models/importSessions.ts`

```typescript
export const checkUndoEligibility = query({
  args: {
    sessionId: v.id("importSessions"),
  },
  returns: v.union(
    v.object({
      eligible: v.literal(true),
      timeRemainingMs: v.number(),
      recordCounts: v.object({
        playerIdentities: v.number(),
        guardianIdentities: v.number(),
        guardianPlayerLinks: v.number(),
        orgPlayerEnrollments: v.number(),
        sportPassports: v.number(),
        skillAssessments: v.number(),
      }),
      totalRecords: v.number(),
    }),
    v.object({
      eligible: v.literal(false),
      reason: v.string(),
    })
  ),
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // 1. Get session, verify status === "completed"
    // 2. Check time window: completedAt + UNDO_WINDOW_MS > Date.now()
    // 3. Check for dependent data: manual assessments (assessmentType !== "import")
    //    linked to players from this import
    // 4. Count records per table using by_importSessionId index
    // 5. Return eligibility with record counts
  },
});
```

**Key patterns:**
- Use `authComponent.getAuthUser(ctx)` for auth
- Use `.withIndex("by_importSessionId", q => q.eq("importSessionId", args.sessionId))` for all 6 tables
- For dependent data check: query `skillAssessments` by `playerIdentityId` where `assessmentType !== "import"` -- NOTE: this will require fetching player IDs first, then checking assessments. Use batch fetch pattern.
- Define `UNDO_WINDOW_MS = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000` as a module-level constant

### US-P2.4-002: undoImport Mutation

**File:** `packages/backend/convex/models/importSessions.ts`

```typescript
export const undoImport = mutation({
  args: {
    sessionId: v.id("importSessions"),
    reason: v.string(),
  },
  returns: v.object({
    success: v.boolean(),
    deletedCounts: v.object({
      playerIdentities: v.number(),
      guardianIdentities: v.number(),
      guardianPlayerLinks: v.number(),
      orgPlayerEnrollments: v.number(),
      sportPassports: v.number(),
      skillAssessments: v.number(),
    }),
  }),
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // 1. Auth check: authComponent.getAuthUser(ctx)
    // 2. Re-verify eligibility (time window + no dependent data)
    // 3. Delete in dependency order:
    //    a. skillAssessments by importSessionId
    //    b. sportPassports by importSessionId
    //    c. orgPlayerEnrollments by importSessionId
    //    d. guardianPlayerLinks by importSessionId
    //    e. guardianIdentities by importSessionId
    //    f. playerIdentities by importSessionId
    // 4. Update session: status -> "undone", set undoneAt/undoneBy/undoReason
    // 5. Return deleted counts
  },
});
```

**Critical patterns:**
- MUST re-verify eligibility inside the mutation (race condition: eligibility could change between query and mutation)
- Use `.withIndex("by_importSessionId")` for ALL table queries, NEVER `.filter()`
- Delete with `for...of` loop calling `ctx.db.delete(doc._id)` for each record
- Convex mutations are atomic: if any delete fails, the entire mutation rolls back

**Transaction safety:**
- Convex limit: 16,000 writes per mutation, 32,000 scans per mutation
- A 200-player import with full guardians/passports/benchmarks: ~3,800 records
- A 500-player import: ~9,500 records -- still within limits
- For imports > 1,000 players: consider chunked approach using `ctx.scheduler.runAfter(0, internal.models.importSessions.undoChunk, {...})` with session locked to `"undoing"` status

### US-P2.4-003: Import History Page

**File:** `apps/web/src/app/orgs/[orgId]/import/history/page.tsx` (NEW)

- Use existing `listSessionsByOrg` query (already filters by org and sorts by `startedAt`)
- Display as a table with columns: Date, File, Status, Records, Undo button
- Undo button visible only when `checkUndoEligibility` returns `eligible: true`
- Follow auth pattern from import `page.tsx`: check admin/owner role via `authClient.organization.getActiveMember()`
- Undo button opens `UndoImportDialog` (US-P2.4-004)
- IMPORTANT: Do NOT call `useQuery(checkUndoEligibility)` in each table row. Instead, call it once when a row's undo button is clicked, or lift the query to the parent and pass down. The PRD says to show undo buttons for "completed" sessions within 24 hours -- this can be computed client-side from `completedAt` without a query per row.

### US-P2.4-004: UndoImportDialog Component

**File:** `apps/web/src/components/import/undo-import-dialog.tsx` (NEW)

- Receives `sessionId`, `organizationId` as props
- On open: calls `checkUndoEligibility` query to get record counts and time remaining
- Shows impact preview (record counts per table)
- Countdown timer showing time remaining in undo window
- Required reason textarea
- Confirm button calls `undoImport` mutation
- Success toast via Sonner
- Use AlertDialog from shadcn/ui (already imported in import page)
- Must work at 375px width (mobile)

### US-P2.4-005: Undo Links on Complete Step and Import Page

**Files:**
- `apps/web/src/components/import/steps/complete-step.tsx` -- Add undo link
- `apps/web/src/app/orgs/[orgId]/import/page.tsx` -- Add undo capability to recent sessions list

For complete-step:
- Thread `sessionId` through as a new prop (currently not passed)
- Add an "Undo Import" link/button below the success header
- Link to the undo dialog or inline the dialog

For import page:
- In the `RecentSessionRow` component, add an undo button for completed sessions within 24 hours
- Compute 24-hour eligibility client-side from `session.completedAt`

---

## 5. Security Patterns

- **Auth:** Use `authComponent.getAuthUser(ctx)` in all new backend functions
- **Role check:** Verify user is admin/owner of the organization. On frontend, use `authClient.organization.getActiveMember()` pattern from existing import page (line 370-394). On backend, verify membership via `ctx.db.query("member").withIndex(...)` or equivalent Better Auth check.
- **Audit trail:** Store `undoneBy` (user ID), `undoneAt` (timestamp), `undoReason` (text) on the import session
- **Rate limiting:** Consider preventing multiple concurrent undo operations on the same session (check status !== "undone" and status !== "undoing")
- **Organization scoping:** The `undoImport` mutation must verify the session belongs to the user's organization

---

## 6. Performance Concerns

| Concern | Impact | Mitigation |
|---------|--------|------------|
| Large import undo exceeds mutation limits | High | Chunk deletes for > 5,000 records using `ctx.scheduler` |
| `checkUndoEligibility` called per row in history table | Medium | Compute 24-hour eligibility client-side; only call full eligibility check on dialog open |
| Scanning 6 tables for record counts | Low | `by_importSessionId` indexes make this efficient |
| In-memory sort in `listSessionsByOrg` | Low | Add `by_org_and_startedAt` index for history page |

---

## 7. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|------------|
| Undo deletes records that other features depend on | Low | `checkUndoEligibility` checks for non-import assessments. 24-hour window limits accumulation. |
| Race condition: two admins undo the same import simultaneously | Low | Re-verify status inside mutation. Convex OCC handles concurrent writes. |
| Schema migration needed for existing records (4 tables missing `importSessionId`) | Certain | Field is `v.optional()` -- no migration needed. Existing records simply won't be undoable, which is correct. |
| Guardian shared across imports -- undo one import deletes guardian needed by another | Medium | See "Critical Risk: Shared Identity Records" below. |

### Critical Risk: Shared Identity Records

**This is the most architecturally significant risk.** The identity tables (`playerIdentities`, `guardianIdentities`) are platform-level, not org-scoped. If two separate imports create enrollments for the same player (matched by name+DOB), the `playerIdentity` will have the `importSessionId` from the FIRST import that created it (`wasCreated: true`), but the second import will have reused it (`wasCreated: false`).

**Undo strategy for shared records:**
- `playerIdentities`: Only delete if `importSessionId === sessionId` (i.e., this import CREATED it). If the identity was reused, skip deletion.
- `guardianIdentities`: Same logic -- only delete if created by this import.
- `guardianPlayerLinks`: Delete if both the guardian and player were created by this import, OR if the link itself was created by this import.
- `orgPlayerEnrollments`: Always safe to delete by `importSessionId` (org-scoped).
- `sportPassports`: Safe to delete if created by this import (track via `importSessionId`).
- `skillAssessments`: Safe to delete if created by this import (track via `importSessionId`).

This means the record counts returned by `checkUndoEligibility` should reflect what WILL be deleted, not just what has the matching `importSessionId`. Records where the identity was reused from a previous import should be excluded from the delete set but their enrollments/passports/assessments should still be deleted.

## 9. GO / NO-GO Recommendation

### **NO-GO** -- 4 critical blockers must be resolved first

Ralph should implement the pre-conditions (C1-C4) as a "Phase 2.4 Pre-Work" commit BEFORE starting the 5 user stories:

**Pre-work commit (estimated: 1-2 hours):**
1. Add `importSessionId` field to 4 tables in schema.ts (C1)
2. Add `by_importSessionId` index to all 6 tables in schema.ts (C2)
3. Update `batchImportPlayersWithIdentity` to set `importSessionId` on all 6 tables (C3)
4. Update `benchmarkApplicator.ts` to accept and pass `importSessionId` (C3)
5. Add `"undone"` status to schema + model validators + transitions (C4)
6. Add undo fields to schema (`undoneAt`, `undoneBy`, `undoReason`) (C4)
7. Run `npx -w packages/backend convex codegen` to verify
8. Run `npm run check-types` to verify no regressions

**After pre-work is merged, the 5 user stories can proceed.** They are largely independent and can be implemented in order: US-001 -> US-002 -> US-003 -> US-004 -> US-005.
