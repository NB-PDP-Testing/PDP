## Story
As a frontend developer, I want to create the skeleton for the My Impact tab so we have a foundation for adding dashboard sections.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Create apps/web/src/app/orgs/[orgId]/coach/voice-notes/components/my-impact-tab.tsx
- [ ] Component exports MyImpactTab function component
- [ ] Component accepts props: { orgId: string, coachId: string }
- [ ] Component uses useQuery to fetch data: const impactData = useQuery(api.models.voiceNotes.getCoachImpactSummary, { coachId, organizationId: orgId, dateRange })
- [ ] Component has date range state: const [dateRange, setDateRange] = useState<'week' | 'month' | 'all'>(() => localStorage.getItem('impact-date-range') as any || 'month')
- [ ] Component has date range picker dropdown at top (options: This Week, This Month, All Time)
- [ ] Loading state: if (impactData === undefined) return <Skeleton /> with 4 card placeholders
- [ ] Error state: if query fails, show error message
- [ ] Empty state: if (impactData.voiceNotesCreated === 0) return <EmptyState message='No activity yet' />
- [ ] Component structure has sections (placeholders for Week 2):
- [ ] {/* Summary cards - placeholder for US-P8-005 */}
- [ ] {/* Sent summaries - placeholder for US-P8-006 */}
- [ ] {/* Applied insights - placeholder for US-P8-007 */}
- [ ] {/* Team observations - placeholder for US-P8-009 */}
- [ ] Type check passes: npm run check-types
