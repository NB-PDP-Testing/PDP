## 📋 QUICK SKILL DESCRIPTORS

### Technical Skills (Ball Mastery, Kicking, Catching, Passing)

| Level | Descriptor | Context |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **1** | Learning technique | Stationary, strong side only |
| **2** | Established technique | Controlled practice, both sides developing |
| **3** | Autonomous technique | Effective in games, good bilateral |
| **4** | Excellent technique | All conditions, equal both sides |
| **5** | Mastery | Elite, can teach others |

### Tactical Skills (Positional, Tracking, Decisions)

| Level | Descriptor | Context |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **1** | Learning concepts | Requires constant coaching |
| **2** | Understands basics | Structured situations |
| **3** | Good awareness | Effective in games |
| **4** | Excellent awareness | Proactive, anticipates play |
| **5** | Elite tactical IQ | Orchestrates, dictates play |

---

## ⚠️ ASSESSMENT RULES

### ✅ DO:
- Observe 3-4 sessions before rating
- Assess in game situations (primary)
- Test fresh AND fatigued
- Rate conservatively
- Use descriptors, not comparisons
- Document conditions

### ❌ DON'T:
- Rate from one session
- Inflate to "be nice"
- Compare to other players
- Focus only on drills
- Rate when injured/ill
- Guess without evidence

---

## 🎮 GAMES-BASED ASSESSMENT

**Priority Order:**
1. **Match play** (competitive games)
2. **Conditioned games** (game-like with constraints)
3. **Small-sided games** (reduced numbers)
4. **Technical drills** (beginners only)

**Why?** Drill perfection ≠ Game effectiveness

---

## 🔄 BILATERAL DEVELOPMENT

**Critical for Higher Ratings:**
- Level 1-2: Strong side only
- Level 3: Adequate both sides
- Level 4: Strong both sides
- Level 5: Equal both sides

**Research:** Left-sided players develop bilaterality faster than right-sided players

**Assessment:** Does player avoid weaker side in matches? If yes → not Level 4+

---

## ⏱️ REASSESSMENT FREQUENCY

| Age | Frequency | Reason |
|-----|-----------|--------|
| U8-U12 | Every 12 weeks | Rapid development |
| U14-U16 | Every 8-10 weeks | Consolidation phase |
| U18+ | Every 6-8 weeks | Training cycles |
| Pre-Season | Baseline | Planning |
| Mid-Season | Progress check | Adjustment |

---

## 💡 PRESSURE DIFFERENTIAL

Skill rating should reflect performance under pressure:

| Level | Pressure Context |
|-------|-----------------|
| **1-2** | No pressure, controlled practice |
| **3** | Moderate pressure, structured games |
| **4** | High pressure, quality opposition |
| **5** | Elite match intensity, inter-county |

**Key:** Player who excels at training but drops off in matches → likely Level 3, not 4

## ⚡ SPECIAL NOTES

### Free Taking
- No official accuracy standards exist in GAA
- Use percentages as guidelines: 70% (Rec), 80% (Comp), 90% (Elite)
- Assess over multiple sessions under pressure

### Tactical Skills
- Develop slower than technical skills
- U8-U10 typically 1.0-1.5 (learning concepts)
- Games-based coaching accelerates development

### Laterality
- Separate assessment OR modifier to other skills
- Elite expectation: equal proficiency both sides
- Track Left/Right Side skills to monitor bilateral progress

### Age Transitions
- U12→U14 particularly challenging (full field, increased physicality)
- Don't immediately downgrade during transition
- Assess over 4-6 weeks after move-up
