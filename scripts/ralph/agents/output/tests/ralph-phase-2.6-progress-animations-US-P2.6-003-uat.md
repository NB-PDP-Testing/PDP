## Story
As a user watching the progress bar, I need smooth animated transitions between percentages rather than jarring jumps.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Wrap progress bar in framer-motion motion.div component
- [ ] Add smooth transition to width property: transition={{ duration: 0.5, ease: 'easeInOut' }}
- [ ] Progress bar animates between percentage updates (e.g., 45% → 50% animates over 0.5s)
- [ ] Use CSS transform for animation (not width) for better performance: transform: scaleX(percentage/100)
- [ ] Add loading shimmer effect to progress bar background (subtle gradient animation)
- [ ] Progress bar color transitions: blue (0-50%), green (50-100%)
- [ ] On completion, progress bar fills to 100% with success pulse animation
- [ ] On error, progress bar shows red color with error shake animation
- [ ] All animations run at 60fps (no jank, test on low-end device if possible)
- [ ] Run npx ultracite fix
