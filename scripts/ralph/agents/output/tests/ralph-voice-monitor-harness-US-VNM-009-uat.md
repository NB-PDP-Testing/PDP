## Story
Create artifacts/page.tsx with filters, expandable rows, cursor-based pagination, and retry buttons. This page SUBSUMES v2-claims functionality. READ FULL DETAILS in phases/PHASE_M6_M7_M8_M9.json.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Create apps/web/src/app/platform/voice-monitoring/artifacts/page.tsx
- [ ] Build filter bar (status, org, date range, source channel, artifactId search)
- [ ] Build table with columns: Artifact ID, Status, Source, Coach, Org, Claims, Disambig, Latency, Cost, Created, Actions
- [ ] CRITICAL: Use usePaginatedQuery for cursor-based pagination (MANDATORY)
- [ ] Implement expandable rows (click to show claims/resolutions/drafts inline)
- [ ] Migrate ClaimRow component from v2-claims (reuse, don't duplicate)
- [ ] Wire retry buttons (call voicePipelineRetry mutations)
- [ ] Extract shared configs (TOPIC_CONFIG, STATUS_CONFIG) from v2-claims first
- [ ] Query NEW getPlatformArtifacts backend query (not getRecentArtifacts)
- [ ] CRITICAL: v2-claims feature parity REQUIRED before deletion in M9
- [ ] Run: npm run check-types
