  "description": "Planned approach to race execution based on event distance, competition level, and athlete strengths. Even pacing optimal for distance records but tactical variations common in championship racing where winning matters more than time. 800m and 1500m require ability to respond to surges while maintaining overall pacing plan. Understanding when to lead versus follow, when to make moves, how to position in pack, and how to use competitors' strengths and weaknesses to maximize own performance.",

      "description": "No race strategy or tactical awareness. Runs same way regardless of competition or race situation - may go out too fast and die, or too conservative and finish with energy remaining. Cannot read race dynamics or respond appropriately to competitors' moves. In distance races, gets boxed in by poor positioning or runs excessive distance on outside of pack. No pacing plan - each race is random effort distribution. Cannot adjust strategy based on conditions (wind, temperature, competition level). Makes poor tactical decisions: leads when should follow, sits when should move, makes move too early or too late. Demonstrates no understanding of race strategy concepts. In championship races, focuses solely on time goal ignoring placement tactics. Cannot execute even simple pre-race plan when competition starts. Shows no awareness of competitors' strengths, weaknesses, or likely tactics."

      "description": "Basic race strategy awareness developing but execution inconsistent. Has pre-race plan but often abandons it when race begins. Beginning to understand pacing concepts but application poor - still goes out too fast frequently. Can recognize some tactical situations (being boxed, need to respond to surge) but response slow or inappropriate. In distance races, positioning improving but still makes basic errors. Attempts to adjust strategy based on conditions but decisions not always sound. Shows some tactical awareness: understands difference between time trial and championship racing, knows own strengths and weaknesses conceptually. Can sometimes execute simple strategy in training but struggles in competition stress. Responds to coaching about tactics but tends to forget plan once race starts. Shows improvement in tactical thinking but significant development needed in execution and decision-making under pressure."

      "label": "Competent",
      "description": "Good race strategy and tactical execution appropriate for club-regional competition. Develops sound pre-race plan considering event, competition, conditions, and own strengths. Executes plan reasonably well though may deviate when unexpected situations arise. Demonstrates good pacing judgment - rarely goes out too fast or too conservative. Can read race dynamics and respond appropriately to most situations. In distance races, positions well in pack, avoids being boxed, runs efficient tangents. Makes reasonable tactical decisions about when to lead, follow, or make moves. Adjusts strategy appropriately for championship racing versus time trials. Understands competitors' tendencies and incorporates into tactical plan. Can execute practiced strategies in competition with moderate consistency. Shows good tactical awareness and decision-making for level. Occasionally outperforms athletes with superior physiology through better tactics. Demonstrates solid understanding of event-specific tactical requirements."

      "label": "Advanced",
      "description": "Excellent race strategy and tactical execution competitive at regional-national level. Develops sophisticated pre-race plans accounting for all relevant factors and contingencies. Executes plan with discipline while maintaining flexibility to adjust as race unfolds. Demonstrates superior pacing judgment across all race distances. Reads race dynamics expertly - anticipates moves before they happen, recognizes opportunities and threats early. In distance races, positions perfectly, uses pack efficiently, executes moves at optimal times. Makes excellent tactical decisions consistently - knows when to lead based on wind and competition, when to sit and cover, when to make decisive move. Adjusts strategy expertly for different race goals (time versus placement). Studies competitors thoroughly and exploits their weaknesses while protecting own vulnerabilities. Executes complex race plans under championship pressure. Frequently wins races through superior tactics despite not being fastest athlete. Competitive advantage through tactical excellence. Can teach tactics to others and explain decision-making process. Serves as model for tactical racing."

      "label": "Elite",
      "description": "World-class race strategy and tactical execution among the most sophisticated globally. Develops comprehensive race plans accounting for all variables with multiple contingency strategies. Executes plans with perfect discipline while adapting flawlessly to changing race dynamics. Demonstrates elite-level tactical awareness and decision-making under maximum pressure of Olympic or World Championship finals. Reads race perfectly - anticipates all moves, creates tactical situations that favor own strengths. Positions ideally throughout races, makes championship-winning moves at precisely correct moments. Makes brilliant tactical decisions that separate champions from competitors - knows exactly when to lead, cover, surge, or kick. Adjusts strategy expertly for rounds (heats, semifinals, finals) to advance while conserving energy. Studies all competitors thoroughly, exploits every tactical advantage. Executes sophisticated multi-lap strategies in championship racing. Wins medals through tactical brilliance even when not the physiologically superior athlete. Demonstrates championship mentality in tactical situations. Among the most tactically sophisticated athletes globally. Serves as international model for race strategy and tactical execution. No tactical errors observable even under extreme championship pressure."

  "assessmentGuidance": "Assess through race observation and post-race discussion. Before races, discuss athlete's planned strategy - is it appropriate for event, competition, conditions, and own abilities? During races, observe execution: pacing distribution (even versus positive/negative split), positioning in pack, responses to surges, timing of moves. After races, discuss decisions made: why positioned there, why made move when did, what was thinking at key moments? Compare planned strategy to actual execution. Track performance across similar race situations - does athlete learn and improve tactically? Note whether athlete studies competitors and incorporates intelligence into plans. Evaluate decision-making under pressure - does athlete make sound choices when fatigued and stressed? Compare race outcomes to physiological predictions - tactical excellence enables outperformance. Video review helpful for analyzing positioning, moves, and tactical situations."
