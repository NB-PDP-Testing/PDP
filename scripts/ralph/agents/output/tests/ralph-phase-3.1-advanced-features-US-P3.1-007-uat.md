## Story
As an admin about to remove players, I need to see what data will be deleted so I can avoid unintended data loss.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Add 'Preview Impact' section in PartialUndoDialog below player list
- [ ] Preview shows cascading deletions for selected players:
- [ ] - Player enrollments: X records
- [ ] - Guardian links: X records (show if guardian will become orphaned)
- [ ] - Sport passports: X records
- [ ] - Team assignments: X records
- [ ] - Skill assessments: X records
- [ ] Warning badge if action will orphan guardians: 'Warning: 3 guardians will have no linked players'
- [ ] Preview updates dynamically as selection changes
- [ ] Use Alert component from shadcn/ui for warnings
- [ ] Backend query: getRemovalImpact(playerIds) returns impact summary
- [ ] Run npx -w packages/backend convex codegen after adding query
- [ ] Run npx ultracite fix before completion
