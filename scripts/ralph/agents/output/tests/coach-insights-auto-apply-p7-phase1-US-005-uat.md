## Story
As a coach, the system learns my agreement rate with AI insight predictions.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] In packages/backend/convex/models/voiceNoteInsights.ts
- [ ] Create applyInsight mutation:
- [ ] Args: { insightId: v.id('voiceNoteInsights') }
- [ ] Returns: v.id('voiceNoteInsights')
- [ ] REFERENCE P5 US-005: packages/backend/convex/models/coachParentSummaries.ts applyParentSummary mutation
- [ ] Before applying insight, add preview mode tracking:
- [ ] Get authenticated userId
- [ ] Get insight from DB
- [ ] Get coach trust level
- [ ] if (trustLevel?.insightPreviewModeStats && !trustLevel.insightPreviewModeStats.completedAt) {
- [ ] Calculate wouldAutoApply (same logic as US-002)
- [ ] Update counters:
- [ ] wouldAutoApplyInsights += (wouldAutoApply ? 1 : 0)
- [ ] coachAppliedThose += (wouldAutoApply ? 1 : 0)
- [ ] agreementRate = newApplied / newInsights
- [ ] completedAt = (newInsights >= 20 ? Date.now() : undefined)
- [ ] }
- [ ] Apply insight: patch status to 'applied', set appliedAt and appliedBy
- [ ] Create dismissInsight mutation with similar tracking:
- [ ] Increment wouldAutoApplyInsights and coachDismissedThose
- [ ] Do NOT increment coachAppliedThose
- [ ] Type check passes
