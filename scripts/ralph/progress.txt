## BLOCKING PRE-WORK (Required Before M6)

✅ **ALL PRE-WORK COMPLETE** (Completed: 2026-02-17 21:50)

1. **Create 5 new backend queries** (per ADR-VNM-026):
   - ✅ `getPlatformArtifacts` - voiceNoteArtifacts.ts (status/date filters, cursor pagination)
   - ✅ `getPlatformArtifactById` - voiceNoteArtifacts.ts (single artifact lookup)
   - ✅ `getPlatformClaimsByArtifact` - voiceNoteClaims.ts (public platform staff query)
   - ✅ `getPlatformDisambiguationForArtifact` - voiceNoteEntityResolutions.ts (public platform staff)
   - ✅ `getPlatformDraftsByArtifact` - insightDrafts.ts (public platform staff)

2. **Modify existing backend query:**
   - ✅ Updated `getRecentEvents` to use `paginationOptsValidator` from `convex/server`

3. **Extract shared configs from v2-claims** (per ADR-VNM-023):
   - ✅ Created `apps/web/src/lib/voice-notes/configs.ts`
   - ✅ Extracted `TOPIC_CONFIG`, `STATUS_CONFIG`, `ARTIFACT_STATUS_CONFIG`
   - ✅ Updated v2-claims page.tsx to import from shared location

**Type Checks:** ✅ PASSING (npm run check-types)

## EXECUTION ORDER

### Step 0: Prep Work (0.5 day) - BLOCKING
- Complete 3 tasks above
- Read feedback.md fully
- Read all 8 ADRs

### Step 1: M6 - Artifacts Grid & Detail (4-5 days)
- **US-VNM-009:** Artifacts grid with filters, expandable rows, pagination
- **US-VNM-010:** Artifact detail page with event timeline

### Step 2: M7 - Metrics & Events (3-4 days, can run parallel with M6)
- **US-VNM-011:** Metrics dashboard with CSS-based charts
- **US-VNM-012:** Event log viewer with filters

### Step 3: M8 - Pipeline & Alerts (3-4 days, can run parallel with M7)
- **US-VNM-013:** Pipeline view with stage drill-down
- **US-VNM-014:** Alerts page with toast notifications

### Step 4: M9 - Cleanup & Polish (2-3 days)
- **US-VNM-015:** Verify v2-claims parity, delete old page, final optimizations

**Estimated Duration:** 12-14 days total

## MANDATORY PATTERNS (Quick Reference)

**Full details in feedback.md and ADRs - this is just a reminder**

1. **Pagination:** ALWAYS use `usePaginatedQuery` (NEVER `.take()`)
2. **Charts:** CSS/SVG only (NO external libraries like Recharts)
3. **Access Control:** Platform staff auth on ALL routes + query skip patterns
4. **Component Reuse:** Migrate v2-claims components (don't duplicate)
5. **v2-Claims Parity:** VERIFY before deletion in M9
6. **Mobile:** Test at 375px minimum
7. **Performance:** Dashboard loads < 2 seconds
8. **Real-time:** Use Convex `useQuery` for live data

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA (ALL must pass)

- [ ] All 8 monitoring pages accessible via tab navigation
- [ ] Cursor-based pagination on all list views (usePaginatedQuery)
- [ ] CSS-based charts (no external libraries)
- [ ] v2-claims functionality migrated to artifacts grid
- [ ] v2-claims page deleted (after verification)
- [ ] Platform staff auth on ALL routes
- [ ] Query skip patterns implemented
- [ ] Dashboard loads < 2 seconds
- [ ] Mobile responsive at 375px minimum
- [ ] Real-time updates work (< 10s lag)
- [ ] E2E tests passing
- [ ] `npm run check-types` passes

## NEXT STORY TO EXECUTE

**US-VNM-009: Build Artifacts Grid View** (M6, 3 days)

✅ Pre-work complete - Ready to begin artifacts grid implementation.

**Key Requirements:**
- Use `getPlatformArtifacts` query (NOT `getRecentArtifacts`)
- Use `usePaginatedQuery` for cursor-based pagination (MANDATORY)
- Migrate ClaimRow component from v2-claims
- Implement expandable rows showing claims/resolutions/drafts
- Wire retry buttons to voicePipelineRetry mutations
- Must achieve v2-claims feature parity (critical for M9 deletion)

## DOCUMENTATION INDEX

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `feedback.md` | Implementation requirements (queries, data, calculations) |
| `ADR-VNM-021` through `ADR-VNM-028` | Architecture decisions |
| `PHASE_M6_M7_M8_M9.json` | Detailed specs, examples, patterns |
| `M1-M5_LESSONS_LEARNED.md` | What to avoid, process improvements |
| `prd.json` | User stories, acceptance criteria |
| `PRD.json` | Main PRD with all phases |

**For implementation details, ALWAYS read feedback.md first.**

## 🔐 SECURITY FINDINGS (2026-02-17 21:49)

**From security-tester agent - FOR AWARENESS (not blocking M6-M9):**

These are existing codebase issues, NOT related to M6-M9 work:

- 🚨 **CRITICAL**: No hardcoded secrets found (false positive - only error messages referencing env vars)
- ⚠️ **HIGH**: 4 high-severity dependency vulnerabilities → Run `npm audit fix`
- ⚠️ **HIGH**: Mutations without authorization checks in 84 files (mostly legacy code)
- 🚨 **CRITICAL**: XSS risk - dangerouslySetInnerHTML in 3 UI components (confetti, chart, gdpr-viewer)

**Action for Ralph:** Note these issues but DO NOT fix during M6-M9 implementation. Focus on monitoring pages only.

---

## ⚠️ M5 DASHBOARD GAPS (DEFERRED)

**From QA review - Deferred to post-M9 cleanup:**

1. **Tab count**: Only 7 tabs (Overview, Artifacts, Metrics, Events, Pipeline, Alerts, Settings)
   - Acceptance criteria specified 8 tabs - missing tab not identified in PRD
   - **Status:** DEFERRED (investigate in M9)

2. **Layout auth**: Client-side auth check instead of server-side
   - Works but doesn't match acceptance criteria
   - **Status:** DEFERRED (acceptable defense-in-depth)

3. **v2-claims link**: Still present in platform page
   - Should be removed when v2-claims page is deleted
   - **Status:** WILL BE FIXED in US-VNM-015 (M9)

4. **Activity Feed grouping**: Missing time grouping features
   - No "Today, Yesterday, This Week" grouping
   - No auto-scroll to top on new events
   - **Status:** DEFERRED (out of scope for M6-M9)

**Impact:** M5 Dashboard is 85% complete, functional, and acceptable for now. These gaps are tracked for future cleanup.
