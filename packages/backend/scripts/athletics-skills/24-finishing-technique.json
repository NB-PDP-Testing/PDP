  "description": "Execution of final meters of race to maximize time and placement. Maintain form and acceleration through finish line - don't \"shut down\" early thinking race is over. Lean at line if close finish: chest forward, arms back (\"dip\" or \"lunge\"). In distance events, tactical positioning in final 400m-800m critical. Kick requires both physiological capacity (speed reserve, lactate tolerance) and psychological commitment (willingness to suffer maximally). Finishing separates champions from competitors when races are close.",

      "description": "Poor finishing technique and mentality costing time and places. Shuts down early, visibly slowing before finish line thinking race is over. No lean or dip attempted at line even in close finishes. Form collapses completely in final meters - stride shortens dramatically, arms flail, posture deteriorates. In distance events, gives up when passed or falls off pace in final laps, cannot respond to surges. No kick or finishing speed - runs same pace or slower through finish. Psychologically defeated before finish line, lacks competitive fire to fight for place. Cannot execute final sprint even when fresh. Demonstrates no understanding of finishing technique or tactics. In close finishes, loses places through poor finishing execution that could be won with proper technique. Shows no willingness to experience maximum suffering in final meters."

      "description": "Basic finishing ability developing but inconsistent execution. Usually runs through finish line but occasionally shuts down early when tired or discouraged. Attempts lean at line sometimes but execution poor - off-balance, mistimed, or insufficient. Form deteriorates noticeably in final meters but doesn't completely collapse. In distance events, tries to respond to moves but often cannot maintain effort when it hurts. Shows some kick ability when not too fatigued but inconsistent. Beginning to develop competitive mentality but gives up sometimes when challenged. Can execute final sprint in training but struggles to reproduce in competition under fatigue. Responds to coaching about finishing but application inconsistent. Shows improvement trajectory in competitive drive and technical execution. Demonstrates awareness that finishing matters but inconsistent follow-through."

      "description": "Good finishing technique and competitive drive appropriate for level. Consistently runs through finish line maintaining effort and form. Executes reasonable lean at line in close finishes - chest forward, arms back, maintains balance. Form degrades moderately in final meters but maintains sufficient mechanics to finish strong. In distance events, positions tactically in final laps, can respond to reasonable surges, executes decent kick. Shows good finishing speed relative to overall ability - has practiced finishing sprints. Competitive mentality solid - fights for every place, doesn't give up when passed. Can tolerate discomfort in final meters to maintain effort. Rarely loses places through poor finishing that could be won. Demonstrates good understanding of finishing tactics and technique. Competitive at club-regional level through solid finishing execution. Self-aware about importance of finishing."

      "description": "Excellent finishing technique and competitive drive creating advantage. Always runs hard through finish line, never shuts down early regardless of circumstances. Executes perfect lean at line in close finishes - precise timing, maximum forward trunk lean, arms thrown back, maintains balance throughout. Maintains excellent form through final meters despite extreme fatigue. In distance events, positions perfectly in final laps, responds aggressively to all moves, executes powerful kick. Demonstrates superior finishing speed - substantial speed reserve allows acceleration when others fading. Exceptional competitive mentality - relishes close finishes, fights maximally for every place. Can tolerate extreme discomfort in final meters. Frequently wins places through superior finishing that competitors with similar ability don't maximize. Competitive advantage through finishing excellence. Can demonstrate perfect technique and explain tactics. Serves as model for finishing execution and competitive drive."

Maintains maximum effort and perfect form through finish line in Olympic and World Championship finals. Executes biomechanically perfect lean at line - has won major championships through superior dip technique. Maintains flawless form through final meters despite world-class pace and extreme fatigue. In distance events, positions perfectly, responds to all tactical moves, executes devastating kick that breaks elite competition. Exceptional finishing speed - speed reserve allows acceleration against world's best when others cannot. Championship mentality - performs best when races are closest, thrives under pressure of tight finishes. Can tolerate maximum suffering in final meters that separates champions from competitors. Wins medals through superior finishing when races are decided by hundredths of seconds or final meters. Demonstrates championship-level competitive drive and technical perfection. Among the best finishers globally. Serves as international model for finishing technique and mental toughness. Decisive competitive advantage in close races at highest level."

  "assessmentGuidance": "Observe final 50-100m of races in sprint events, final 400m-800m of distance events. Note whether athlete maintains effort through finish line versus shutting down early. Watch for lean execution in close finishes: timing, forward chest lean degree, arm throw-back, balance maintenance. Observe form maintenance: stride length, arm action, posture in final meters. In distance events, assess tactical positioning in closing laps and ability to respond to surges. Note finishing speed relative to race pace - can athlete accelerate when others cannot? Evaluate competitive drive: does athlete fight for every place or give up when challenged? Video analysis helpful for reviewing lean technique and form maintenance. Compare finish line times in close races - did proper technique win or lose places? Assess psychological approach to finishing: embraces challenge versus dreads it."
