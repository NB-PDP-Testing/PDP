## Story
As an admin, I need a page showing all past imports with their status, stats, and undo eligibility.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Create apps/web/src/app/orgs/[orgId]/import/history/page.tsx
- [ ] Admin/owner role check with redirect (same pattern as admin/layout.tsx)
- [ ] Fetch import sessions using listSessionsByOrg query (already exists)
- [ ] Table with columns: Date, Source (file name), Status badge, Rows Imported, Players Created, Guardians Created, Actions
- [ ] Status badges: completed (green), failed (red), cancelled (gray), undone (amber), importing (blue animated)
- [ ] For 'completed' sessions, show Undo button if within 24-hour window
- [ ] Undo button calls checkUndoEligibility to verify — show tooltip if ineligible
- [ ] Clicking Undo opens UndoImportDialog
