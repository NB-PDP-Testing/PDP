  "branchName": "ralph/phase-2.6-progress-animations",
  "description": "Complete the missing professional progress animations from Phase 2.5. Add live stats counter, current operation display, smooth progress bar animations, and enhanced error collection UI during import. This provides real-time feedback to users as imports execute, improving UX and making long imports feel faster.",
