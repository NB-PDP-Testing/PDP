## Story
As a user watching an import, I need to see which player is currently being processed so I have detailed progress feedback.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Extend progress tracker from US-P2.6-001 to include currentOperation field
- [ ] currentOperation format: 'Creating identity for [FirstName LastName]'
- [ ] Update batchImportPlayersWithIdentity mutation to set currentOperation before processing each player
- [ ] Update import-step.tsx to display current operation below stats card
- [ ] Current operation text should be: 'Currently: Creating identity for Emma Walsh'
- [ ] Text updates smoothly (fade transition between names using framer-motion)
- [ ] On import completion, current operation shows 'Import complete!'
- [ ] On import failure, current operation shows 'Import stopped at [PlayerName]'
- [ ] Mobile responsive: truncate long names with ellipsis at small widths
- [ ] Run npx ultracite fix
