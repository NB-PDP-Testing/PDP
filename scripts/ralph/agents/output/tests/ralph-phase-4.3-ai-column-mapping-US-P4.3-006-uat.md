## Story
As an org admin during CSV import, I want to see AI-suggested column mappings so I can quickly review and accept them instead of mapping manually.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Update apps/web/src/components/import/steps/mapping-step.tsx
- [ ] Add 'Get AI Suggestions' button above mapping table
- [ ] Button disabled if no CSV uploaded or columns already mapped
- [ ] On click, call suggestAllMappings action with column names and sample values
- [ ] Show loading spinner: 'AI is analyzing your columns...'
- [ ] On response, update UI to show AI suggestions:
- [ ] - HIGH confidence (80%+): green badge 'AI Suggested' with checkmark icon
- [ ] - MEDIUM confidence (50-79%): yellow badge 'AI Suggested' with warning icon
- [ ] - LOW confidence (<50%): red badge 'AI Suggested' with question icon
- [ ] Display confidence percentage and reasoning in tooltip (hover over badge)
- [ ] Add 'Accept' button next to each suggestion (green checkmark icon)
- [ ] Add 'Reject' button next to each suggestion (red X icon)
- [ ] On Accept: update mapping, mark column as mapped, remove suggestion badge
- [ ] On Reject: clear suggestion, show manual dropdown for that column
- [ ] Add 'Accept All High Confidence' button to bulk-accept 80%+ suggestions
- [ ] Show summary: 'AI suggested X of Y columns (Z% confidence)'
- [ ] Run npx ultracite fix
