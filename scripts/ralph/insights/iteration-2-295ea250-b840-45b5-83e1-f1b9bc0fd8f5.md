- Let me check one of these existing components to understand the pattern, and also check if there's a coach directory:
- Good! I can see the pattern. Now let me create the coach directory and the TrustLevelIndicator component:

## Gotchas & Learnings

- ✅ **US-015-016**: Trust Preference Settings component with level selection and warnings
