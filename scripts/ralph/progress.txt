## Codebase Patterns
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-25 19:55 - Iteration 1

### Architecture
- All routes scoped under `/orgs/[orgId]/` except platform routes
- Platform routes under `/platform/` - protected by platform layout
- Use Better Auth for authentication, Convex for backend
- Organization data isolated via organizationId field

### Platform Routes Pattern
- All `/platform/*` routes automatically check `user.isPlatformStaff` via layout.tsx
- No need for per-page authorization checks
- Platform pages use consistent styling (gradient header, white content card)
- Platform dashboard has navigation cards linking to sub-sections

### Frontend Patterns
- Use shadcn/ui components from `@/components/ui`
- Tabs component for multi-section pages (Tabs, TabsList, TabsTrigger, TabsContent)
- Lucide icons for all iconography
- Consistent color palette for platform cards (amber, blue, purple, green, cyan, indigo)

### Quality Checks
- Run in order: `npm run check-types` → `npx ultracite fix` → `npm run check`
- Pre-commit hooks run automatically on commit
- Linter may auto-remove unused imports - add usage before import

## 2026-01-25 19:55 - US-017 - Create platform messaging admin page structure
**Iteration**: 1
**Commit**: e24e50d469631ead3585ef48e24b96c9b850eb35
**Session**: 849235ae-2447-4dd0-948a-8918a42bca08
**Status**: Complete

### What was implemented
- Created `/platform/messaging/page.tsx` with complete tab structure
- Implemented 5 tabs: Overview, Cost Analytics, Rate Limits, Service Health, Settings
- Each tab has placeholder Card component with description and implementation reference
- Added navigation card to platform dashboard page linking to messaging section
- Used Lucide icons for visual consistency (LayoutDashboard, DollarSign, Gauge, Activity, Settings, MessageSquare)
- Authorization automatically handled by existing platform layout.tsx (isPlatformStaff check)

### Files changed
- apps/web/src/app/platform/messaging/page.tsx (NEW, +165 lines)
- apps/web/src/app/platform/page.tsx (+20 lines for navigation card)

### Quality checks
- ✅ Type check: passed
- ✅ Linting: passed (pre-commit hooks)
- ⏭️ Browser verification: not needed (structural setup only, will test when tabs have content)

### Learnings for future iterations ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Patterns discovered:**
- Platform layout.tsx already provides isPlatformStaff protection for all /platform/* routes
- No need to add auth checks in individual platform pages
- Linter auto-removes unused imports - must add component usage before import, or add them together
- Platform pages follow consistent structure: gradient header + white content card

**Gotchas encountered:**
- Linter aggressively removes unused imports in real-time
- When adding icon import and usage separately, import gets removed before usage is added
- Solution: Add the component usage first, then add the import (or use Edit to add both)

**Dependencies found:**
- Platform messaging page is independent, no dependencies yet
- Will need backend queries for future tabs (US-018 onwards)

**What to do next**:
- [ ] US-018: Build Cost Analytics tab - needs getOrgUsage query or new getPlatformUsage
- [ ] US-019: Build Rate Limits tab - needs rate limit queries/mutations
- [ ] US-020: Build Service Health tab - needs aiServiceHealth query
- [ ] US-021: Build Settings tab - needs platformMessagingSettings table
- [ ] US-022: Build Overview tab - aggregates data from all other tabs

**Mistakes made**:
- Initially tried to add MessageSquare import before adding its usage - linter removed it
- Fixed by adding the card usage first, then the import stayed
