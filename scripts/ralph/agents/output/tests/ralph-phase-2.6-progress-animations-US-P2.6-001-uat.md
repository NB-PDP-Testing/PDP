## Story
As a user running an import, I need to see live statistics updating in real-time so I know how many records have been created.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Update batchImportPlayersWithIdentity mutation to yield progress updates every 10-20 records
- [ ] Add internal mutation helper: yieldProgress(stats) that updates a progress tracker
- [ ] Progress tracker stores: { playersCreated, guardiansCreated, enrollmentsCreated, passportsCreated, currentPlayerName, phase, percentage }
- [ ] Frontend polls progress tracker during import (every 500ms) using a query
- [ ] Update import-step.tsx to display live stats in a stats card above progress bar
- [ ] Stats card shows: 'Players: X/Y • Guardians: A/B • Enrollments: C/D • Passports: E/F'
- [ ] Stats update smoothly without flickering
- [ ] On import completion, final stats displayed match actual created counts
- [ ] Run npx ultracite fix and npx -w packages/backend convex codegen
