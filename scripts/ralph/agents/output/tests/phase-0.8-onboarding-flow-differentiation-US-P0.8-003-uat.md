## Story
As a self-registered user, I should NOT see guardian matching during onboarding - that happens at admin approval.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Edit packages/backend/convex/models/onboarding.ts
- [ ] In getOnboardingTasks query, fetch user.wasInvited flag

- [ ] Wrap guardian matching logic (Priority 2 section) with: if (wasInvited) { ... }
- [ ] Guardian matching query and guardian_claim task creation only runs for invited users
- [ ] Self-registered users skip directly to onboarding completion after profile_completion
- [ ] Typecheck passes: npm run check-types
- [ ] Test: Self-registered user completes profile -> No guardian_claim task shown
