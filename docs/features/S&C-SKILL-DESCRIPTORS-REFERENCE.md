## 📋 RATING CHECKLIST

Before submitting each rating, ask yourself:

- ☐ Have I observed this skill in **3+ different sessions**?
- ☐ Have I seen it performed **fresh AND fatigued**?
- ☐ Have I compared to the **descriptor** (not other athletes)?
- ☐ Am I rating **current ability** (not potential or past)?
- ☐ Would I defend this rating to **another coach**?
- ☐ Have I documented **context and notes**?

If you answer NO to any question, observe more before rating.

## 🎯 CONSISTENCY TIPS

### Compare Within Same Session
✅ Rate all similar skills together (e.g., all strength skills)
✅ Helps maintain consistent standards

### Use Video When Possible
✅ Movement quality skills especially benefit from video review
✅ Can re-watch and compare to descriptors more accurately

### Calibrate with Other Coaches
✅ Occasionally rate same athlete independently
✅ Discuss differences to align understanding
✅ Builds team consistency

### Review Previous Ratings
✅ Before reassessment, review previous ratings
✅ Significant jumps (±1.0) should have clear evidence
✅ Progress is usually gradual (0.2-0.5 per 6-8 weeks)
