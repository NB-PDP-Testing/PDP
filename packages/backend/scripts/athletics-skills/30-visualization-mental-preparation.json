  "description": "Mental practice of race execution, technique, and tactics through systematic imagery. Activates same neural circuits as physical performance, enhancing motor learning and reducing anxiety. Athletes visualize races beforehand creating mental blueprint for execution and positive outcomes. Part of comprehensive pre-race routine. Effective visualization includes sensory detail (visual, auditory, kinesthetic), emotional components, and both process (how to execute) and outcome (successful result) imagery. Used for skill development, race preparation, confidence building, and anxiety management.",

      "label": "Developing",
      "description": "No visualization or mental preparation practice. Never thinks about upcoming races or performances beforehand except to worry. If attempting visualization, images unclear and disconnected - cannot create coherent mental movie of race execution. Cannot hold mental images for more than few seconds before mind wanders. No sensory detail in any imagery - just vague thoughts about racing. Never visualizes technique execution or tactical situations. No pre-race mental routine - approaches races haphazardly without psychological preparation. Demonstrates no understanding of mental preparation importance. May visualize negative outcomes (failing, losing, getting hurt) reinforcing anxiety rather than confidence. Shows no awareness that mental practice can enhance physical performance. Cannot imagine successful execution or positive outcomes - pessimistic mental approach. Demonstrates no mental skills training background."

      "label": "Emerging",
      "description": "Basic visualization attempts but execution poor and inconsistent. Thinks about upcoming races occasionally but imagery vague and unfocused. Can create brief mental images (10-20 seconds) but cannot sustain visualization for full race. Some sensory detail emerging but images primarily visual with limited auditory or kinesthetic components. Attempts to visualize technique or tactics occasionally but images unclear. Beginning to develop simple pre-race routine including some mental preparation elements. Understands visualization might be helpful but uncertain how to practice effectively. Sometimes visualizes negative outcomes but becoming aware this is counterproductive. Can imagine successful execution briefly but cannot sustain positive imagery. Responds to visualization coaching but struggles with consistent practice. Shows some improvement in mental preparation but technique underdeveloped. Demonstrates awareness of mental preparation importance but limited implementation."

      "label": "Competent",
      "description": "Good visualization ability as regular part of mental preparation. Thinks through upcoming races systematically creating mental blueprint for execution. Can visualize race or performance for 2-5 minutes with reasonable continuity and detail. Includes good sensory detail: clear visual images, some sounds (gun, breathing, crowd), beginning to incorporate feel (kinesthetic). Regularly visualizes technique execution and tactical scenarios. Has established pre-race routine including visualization component - provides psychological preparation and confidence. Understands visualization principles and practices regularly (several times per week minimum). Primarily visualizes successful execution and positive outcomes - uses imagery to build confidence. Can imagine overcoming challenges and adversity during races. Uses visualization for both learning (technique work) and preparation (upcoming races). Demonstrates competent mental preparation appropriate for club-regional level. Shows consistent practice creating meaningful benefit."

      "label": "Advanced",
      "description": "Excellent visualization ability as core mental skill. Creates detailed, vivid mental imagery of races including full sensory experience: clear visual images, sounds (gun, splits, competitors, crowd), kinesthetic feel (running sensations, fatigue progression), even emotions (excitement, confidence, determination). Can visualize entire race from start to finish with perfect continuity and rich detail. Regularly visualizes technique execution, tactical situations, and performance scenarios. Has sophisticated pre-race routine with visualization as centerpiece - provides optimal psychological state. Practices visualization systematically and frequently (daily or near-daily). Visualizes successful execution including how to handle challenges and adversity. Uses imagery for multiple purposes: skill learning, race preparation, confidence building, anxiety management, recovery from setbacks. Demonstrates advanced mental preparation competitive at regional-national level. Competitive advantage through superior mental skills. Can teach visualization to others. Serves as model for mental preparation excellence."

      "label": "Elite",
      "description": "World-class visualization ability among the most sophisticated mental skills globally. Creates exceptionally vivid, detailed mental imagery indistinguishable from actual experience - full sensory immersion including visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and emotional components. Can visualize any performance scenario with perfect detail and continuity for extended durations. Masters all visualization applications: technique refinement, race preparation, tactical rehearsal, confidence building, anxiety management, injury recovery, performance breakthroughs. Has perfected pre-race routine including championship-level visualization - provides optimal psychological state for Olympic and World Championship finals. Practices visualization systematically as core training component. Visualizes not only successful execution but all possible scenarios including adversity, then mentally rehearses optimal responses. Uses imagery to perform mental trials and develop tactical solutions. Demonstrates elite-level mental preparation. Mental practice contributes meaningfully to world-class performance. Among the best globally at mental preparation and imagery use. Serves as international model for visualization and mental skills. Wins championships partly through superior mental preparation when competing against similarly talented athletes."

  "assessmentGuidance": "Assess through discussion and guided imagery sessions. Ask about pre-race mental preparation: does athlete think through upcoming races? What mental activities occur before competition? Conduct guided visualization session observing athlete's ability to create and sustain imagery. Discuss imagery content: how vivid and detailed are mental images? What senses are included (visual, auditory, kinesthetic)? Can athlete visualize full race or just fragments? Evaluate visualization practice frequency and consistency. Note visualization applications: only race preparation or also technique work, confidence building, other uses? Discuss emotional component: does visualization generate confidence and positive emotions or anxiety? Observe pre-competition routine: does it include systematic mental preparation? Track whether visualization practice correlates with improved performance confidence and execution. Use sport psychology imagery assessments if available. Remember visualization is trainable skill improving with systematic practice - athletes should practice imagery regularly, not just before competitions."
