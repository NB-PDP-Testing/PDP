# UAT Test: US-P2.2-003 - Polish simulation UX and edge cases

> Auto-generated: 2026-02-13 21:03
> Status: ⏳ Pending Execution

## Story
As an admin, I need the simulation flow to handle edge cases gracefully and feel polished.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Show estimated time if simulation takes >2 seconds (based on row count)
- [ ] If no rows are selected, show empty state instead of running simulation
- [ ] If wizard data hasn't changed since last simulation, show cached results instead of re-running
- [ ] Add a 'Re-run Simulation' button if user goes back and changes data, then returns
- [ ] Simulation results persist in wizard state so navigating back and forward doesn't lose them
- [ ] Clear simulation results when underlying data changes (mappings, selections, benchmark settings)
- [ ] Run npx ultracite fix and npm run check-types

## Playwright E2E Tests
- Run: `npx -w apps/web playwright test --config=uat/playwright.config.ts -g "US-P2.2-003"`
