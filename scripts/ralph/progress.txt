## Codebase Patterns
**Last Updated**: 2026-02-14 22:35 - Iteration 1

### Architecture
- All routes scoped under `/orgs/[orgId]/`
- Use Better Auth for authentication, Convex for backend
- Organization data isolated via organizationId field

### Convex Backend Patterns
- NEVER use `.filter()` - always use `.withIndex()`
- All functions need `args` and `returns` validators
- Use `Id<"tableName">` types, not `string`
- Index names include all fields: `by_orgId_and_status`

### Guardian Matching System
- Guardian matcher located in `packages/backend/convex/lib/matching/guardianMatcher.ts`
- Shared between import and onboarding flows
- Weights on 100-point scale: Email 40%, Phone 30%, Name 20%, Address 10%
- Confidence levels: High (60+), Medium (40-59), Low (20-39)
- Returns `MatchResult` with score, confidence level, and matchReasons array

### Import Session Schema
- Located in `packages/backend/convex/models/importSessions.ts`
- Uses validators for all data structures
- Duplicate info includes confidence scoring as of Phase 3.1
- Frontend types in `apps/web/src/components/import/steps/review-step.tsx`

### Frontend Patterns
- Use shadcn/ui components from `@/components/ui`
- Import step components in `apps/web/src/components/import/steps/`
- DuplicateInfo type shared via import from review-step.tsx

### Quality Checks
- Run in order: `npx -w packages/backend convex codegen` → `npm run check-types` → `npx ultracite fix` → `npm run check`
- Ultracite must run before linting or you'll get false failures
- Pre-commit hooks run automatically on commit

## 2026-02-14 22:35 - US-P3.1-001 - Add confidence score display to guardian matching
**Iteration**: 1
**Commit**: 041c2d910b96664f7e019f4857512e14c0d1e085
**Session**: 71a2030c-5512-4cbf-b518-529d0cc2543c
**Status**: Complete

### What was implemented
- Updated guardian matching weights in `guardianMatcher.ts` to align with PRD specification:
  * Email match: 40% (reduced from 50%)
  * Phone match: 30% (unchanged)
  * Name similarity: 20% (added SURNAME_ONLY weight for name-only matches)
  * Address match: 10% (postcode/town)
- Adjusted composite weights:
  * SURNAME_POSTCODE: 30 (20% name + 10% address)
  * SURNAME_TOWN: 25 (20% name + 5% partial address)
- Extended `duplicateValidator` in importSessions.ts to include optional `guardianConfidence` object:
  * score: 0-100 confidence score
  * level: "high" | "medium" | "low"
  * matchReasons: array of string explanations
- Updated frontend `DuplicateInfo` type in review-step.tsx to match backend schema
- Type propagates automatically to import-wizard.tsx via import

### Files changed
- packages/backend/convex/lib/matching/guardianMatcher.ts (+10, -5)
- packages/backend/convex/models/importSessions.ts (+8, -1)
- apps/web/src/components/import/steps/review-step.tsx (+7, -1)

### Quality checks
- ✅ Convex codegen: passed
- ✅ Type checking: passed (no new errors)
- ✅ Linting: passed (pre-existing warnings only)
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks: passed
- ⏭️ Browser verification: not applicable (backend-only changes)

### **Learnings for future iterations** ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Patterns discovered:**
- Guardian matcher uses multi-signal scoring on 100-point scale
- Confidence levels calculated by `getConfidenceLevel(score)` helper
- Match reasons stored as human-readable strings for UI display
- Weights defined as constants at top of guardianMatcher.ts for easy tuning

**Gotchas encountered:**
- None - existing guardian matcher already had scoring infrastructure
- Only needed to adjust weights and persist scores in schema

**Dependencies found:**
- Frontend DuplicateInfo type must match backend duplicateValidator
- Both use optional guardianConfidence field (not all duplicates have guardian matches)
- Import from review-step.tsx propagates type to import-wizard.tsx

**What to do next**:
- [ ] US-P3.1-002: Add color-coded confidence badges to duplicate resolution UI
- [ ] Display confidence indicators in review-step.tsx DuplicateCard component
- [ ] Add Progress component for visual score bar
- [ ] Mobile-test the confidence indicators

**Mistakes made**:
- None - straightforward implementation aligned with existing patterns
