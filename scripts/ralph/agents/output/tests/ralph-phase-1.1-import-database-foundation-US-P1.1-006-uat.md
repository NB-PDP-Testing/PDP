## Story
As the import system, I need to create sessions, track status transitions, store player selections, and record import statistics.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Create packages/backend/convex/models/importSessions.ts
- [ ] Implement createImportSession mutation (creates with status 'uploading', returns session ID)
- [ ] Implement updateSessionStatus mutation (validates status transitions)
- [ ] Implement updatePlayerSelections mutation (stores array of row selections)
- [ ] Implement setBenchmarkSettings mutation (stores benchmark configuration)
- [ ] Implement recordSessionStats mutation (stores final import statistics)
- [ ] Implement getSession query (by ID, returns full session data)
- [ ] Implement listSessionsByOrg query (by organizationId, ordered by startedAt desc, using by_org_and_status index)
- [ ] All queries use .withIndex() - never .filter()
