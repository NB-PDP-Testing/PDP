## Story
As the system, rate limits prevent abuse.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Edit processVoiceNoteInsight action in actions/coachParentSummaries.ts
- [ ] Edit processVoiceNoteInsight action in actions/coachParentSummaries.ts
- [ ] BEFORE budget check (US-004), add rate limit check: const rateCheck = await ctx.runQuery(api.models.rateLimits.checkRateLimit, { organizationId })
- [ ] BEFORE budget check (US-004), add rate limit check: const rateCheck = await ctx.runQuery(api.models.rateLimits.checkRateLimit, { organizationId })
- [ ] If !rateCheck.allowed: log warning, return early with error explaining rate limit and resetAt time
- [ ] If !rateCheck.allowed: log warning, return early with error explaining rate limit and resetAt time
- [ ] After successful AI call (both classify and generate complete), increment rate limit counter: ctx.runMutation(internal.models.rateLimits.incrementRateLimit, { organizationId, cost: calculatedCost })
- [ ] After successful AI call (both classify and generate complete), increment rate limit counter: ctx.runMutation(internal.models.rateLimits.incrementRateLimit, { organizationId, cost: calculatedCost })
- [ ] Typecheck passes
