# Rugby Skill Standards Research
**Comprehensive Analysis for PlayerARC Assessment System**

**Date:** February 3, 2026
**Scope:** 44 Rugby Skills | U10-Senior | Male/Female | Recreational/Competitive/Elite

## Executive Summary

### Key Findings

1. **No Official 1-5 Rating System Exists**
   - World Rugby, RFU, IRFU, WRU, SRU publish NO numerical skill rating scales
   - Assessment is qualitative and coach-determined
   - Only validated tool: Bangor Rugby Assessment Tool (BRAT) uses 1-7 Likert scale

2. **Technical Skills Are Gender-Neutral**
   - Same technique coaching points apply to male and female players
   - Physical performance standards differ by gender (strength, speed)
   - Technical skill expectations are identical

3. **Age-Grade Progression is Safety-Driven**
   - Tag rugby (U8-U9, non-contact)
   - Progressive contact introduction (U10-U12)
   - Full contact with restrictions (U13+)
   - Tackle height restrictions by age group

4. **Limited Quantitative Benchmarks**
   - Physical testing standards exist (CMJ, sprint, strength)
   - NO published standards for skill success rates
   - NO official passing accuracy or tackle completion percentages

5. **Elite Identification Focus**
   - Skill-based characteristics discriminate more than physical
   - Regional academies select at U15
   - Multi-dimensional assessment (physical, technical, tactical, cognitive)

### Research Gaps

- ❌ No numerical skill rating descriptors
- ❌ No pass accuracy benchmarks by age
- ❌ No kicking distance/accuracy targets
- ❌ No tackle completion percentage standards
- ❌ No position-specific skill thresholds
- ❌ No recreational vs competitive numerical standards

## Gender Considerations

### Key Principle: Same Technical Standards

**Technical skill execution quality is identical for male and female players:**
- Passing technique = same coaching points
- Tackling technique = same safety standards
- Kicking technique = same fundamentals
- Tactical understanding = same development pathway

### Physical Performance Differences

**Where male and female standards differ:**

**Strength:**
- Elite female forwards: Greater lean/fat mass than backs
- Male forwards: Significantly stronger than female counterparts
- Standards: Gender-specific for physical testing only

**Speed:**
- Elite females: Faster than club-level females
- Elite males: Faster than elite females
- Standards: Gender-specific for sprint times

**Aerobic Capacity:**
- Elite females: Better Yo-Yo test scores than club-level
- Males: Generally higher VO2max
- Standards: Gender-specific for endurance testing

**Power:**
- Jump height, medicine ball throw differ by gender
- Same technique coaching, different performance standards

### Skill Benchmarks: Gender-Specific or Not?

**Our Recommendation: HYBRID APPROACH**

#### Use "All" Gender for:
- **Technical execution quality** (U10-U12)
- **Tactical skills** (all ages)
- **Skills where technique = performance** (passing accuracy, catching consistency)

#### Use Gender-Specific for:
- **Contact skills with strength component** (tackle completion, breakdown dominance) at U14+
- **Kicking distance** (physical power required) at U14+
- **Running evasion under pressure** (speed differential matters) at U14+

### Example Application:

**Pass Accuracy (Left) - U14 Competitive:**
- **Standard:** "all" gender
- **Rating 4 descriptor:** "Accurate 7m pass under pressure, both genders"
- **Rationale:** Technique quality, not strength/speed

**Tackle Completion - U16 Competitive:**
- **Standard:** Gender-specific (male/female)
- **Rating 4 male:** "80%+ completion, dominant tackles"
- **Rating 4 female:** "80%+ completion, dominant tackles"
- **Rationale:** Same description, but applied to gender-specific competition context

**Kicking Distance - U16 Elite:**
- **Standard:** Gender-specific
- **Rating 4 male:** "45m+ punt consistently"
- **Rating 4 female:** "40m+ punt consistently"
- **Rationale:** Physical power differential (5m difference appropriate)

### Youth Development (U10-U12)

**Mixed gender teams permitted until age 13:**
- Same standards apply to all players
- No gender-specific benchmarks at this age
- Focus on fundamental skill development

---

---

### Skill-Specific Rating Considerations

**For each of the 44 skills, level descriptors should include:**

1. **Technical Execution Quality**
   - What does technique look like at each level?
   - Consistency expectations?

2. **Pressure Context**
   - No pressure (practice)
   - Light pressure (passive defense)
   - Moderate pressure (active defense)
   - Heavy pressure (multiple defenders, fatigue)

3. **Game Application**
   - Executes in drills only (Level 1-2)
   - Executes in game situations (Level 3-4)
   - Dominates in games (Level 5)

4. **Age-Appropriate Adjustments**
   - U10 Level 2 = different from U18 Level 2
   - Context matters (what's "proficient" for age?)

5. **Position-Specific Considerations**
   - Kicking: Backs vs Forwards different expectations
   - Tackling: Forwards more dominant expected
   - Passing: All positions high expectations

## Recommendations for PlayerARC Implementation

### 1. Use Hybrid Gender Approach
- "All" for technical skills at youth level (U10-U12)
- Gender-specific for physical-dependent skills at older ages (U14+)

### 2. Create Skill-Specific Descriptors
- All 44 skills need unique 1-5 descriptors
- Base on coaching points from this research
- Include pressure context and age-appropriateness

### 3. Emphasize Safety for Contact Skills
- Progressive development mandatory
- Coaching certification requirements noted
- Tackle technique is highest priority

### 4. Position-Specific Expectations
- Some skills more important for certain positions
- Consider weighting or notes for positions

### 5. Acknowledge Research Gaps
- No official numerical standards exist
- System is research-informed, not officially sanctioned
- Qualitative assessment remains primary in rugby

### 6. Benchmark Count
Potential benchmarks:
- 44 skills
- 6 age groups (U10, U12, U14, U16, U18, Senior)
- Levels: U10 (1), U12 (2), U14+ (3)
- Genders: Some "all", some "male/female"

**Estimated:** 800-1000 benchmarks needed
