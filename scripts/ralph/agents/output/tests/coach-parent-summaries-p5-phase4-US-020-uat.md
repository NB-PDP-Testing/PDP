# UAT Test: US-020 - Implement adaptive confidence thresholds per coach

> Auto-generated: 2026-01-25 00:44
> Status: ⏳ Pending Execution

## Story
As a coach, my confidence threshold adapts based on my approval patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Edit packages/backend/convex/lib/autoApprovalDecision.ts
- [ ] Add calculatePersonalizedThreshold function with args:
- [ ] - coachOverrideHistory (from getCoachOverridePatterns)
- [ ] - defaultThreshold (0.7)
- [ ] Logic:
- [ ] - Count approvals of low confidence (60-70% range)
- [ ] - Count rejections of high confidence (80%+ range)
- [ ] - If >50% approval rate for 60-70% confidence: lower threshold by 5% (coach is trusting)
- [ ] - If >20% rejection rate for 80%+ confidence: raise threshold by 5% (coach is conservative)
- [ ] - Cap adjustments: minimum 0.6, maximum 0.85 (safety bounds)
- [ ] Add personalizedThreshold field to coachTrustLevels schema: v.optional(v.number())
- [ ] Create adjustPersonalizedThresholds scheduled function in packages/backend/convex/crons.ts:
- [ ] - Runs weekly (every Sunday at 2 AM)
- [ ] - For each active coach with >20 override decisions
- [ ] - Calculate new personalized threshold
- [ ] - Update coachTrustLevels record
- [ ] Use personalizedThreshold in autoApprovalDecision if it exists (fallback to confidenceThreshold or 0.7)
- [ ] Typecheck passes: npm run check-types
