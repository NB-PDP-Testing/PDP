  "description": "Transfer of baton between relay runners within 20-meter exchange zone, executed without dropping or fumbling. Non-visual (blind) exchanges for 4x100m use downsweep, upsweep, or push pass methods. Visual exchanges for 4x400m and longer. Outgoing runner reaches maximum controllable speed before exchange. Verbal command (typically \"Stick!\" or \"Hand!\") when 2 arm-lengths away. Receiver's hand provides stationary target, palm out, thumb down. Teams spend hundreds of hours perfecting exchanges as poor handoffs lose races.",

      "description": "Learning basic handoff with frequent fumbles, drops, and violations. No consistent exchange method established - varies randomly between attempts. Receiver's hand position poor and unstable - moving target makes exchange difficult. Outgoing runner starts too early (leaving zone) or too late (incoming runner must slow down). Verbal command absent, mistimed, or unclear. Exchange occurs outside optimal zone location, wasting meters. Visual checking common even in non-visual exchanges, slowing outgoing runner. Drops baton frequently requiring restart. Violates exchange zone boundaries regularly. Cannot maintain running speed through exchange - both runners slow significantly. No timing established between partners. Demonstrates fundamental misunderstanding of relay exchange mechanics. Multiple practice attempts required to complete single successful exchange. Cannot compete successfully in relay events due to technical incompetence in exchanges."

      "description": "Basic handoff ability with some consistency but frequent errors. Establishing exchange method (downsweep, upsweep, or push pass for 4x100m) but execution inconsistent. Receiver's hand position improving but still some movement and instability. Outgoing runner timing better but not optimized - sometimes too early or late. Verbal command present but may be mistimed or unclear. Exchange location improving, occurring within zone more consistently. Occasional drops or fumbles, particularly under pressure. Visual checking reduced in non-visual exchanges but still happens sometimes. Speed maintenance improving but both runners still slow somewhat. Beginning to develop timing with regular partners. Responds to coaching but requires many repetitions to improve. Shows improvement trajectory. Can complete relay races but exchanges cost time and occasionally result in disqualification. Nervous about exchanges, particularly in competition."

      "description": "Good handoff technique enabling competent relay racing. Consistent exchange method mastered (specific technique for event). Receiver's hand steady target - palm out, thumb down, arm extended. Outgoing runner timing good - reaches near-maximum controllable speed by exchange. Verbal command clear and well-timed - called at appropriate distance (2 arm-lengths). Exchange occurs in optimal zone location maximizing distance covered. Rare drops or fumbles, typically only when extremely tired or distracted. Non-visual exchanges properly blind - no looking back by outgoing runner. Both runners maintain reasonable speed through exchange zone. Good timing with regular partners, moderate adjustment needed for new partners. Can self-correct if exchange feeling off. Competitive at club-regional level relay competition. Demonstrates solid understanding of exchange mechanics and timing. Exchanges add minimal time penalty, occasionally gaining time on competitors with superior execution."

      "label": "Advanced",
      "description": "Excellent handoff technique competitive at regional-national relay level. Perfect exchange method execution - downsweep, upsweep, or push pass flawlessly performed. Receiver's hand rock-solid stationary target in optimal position. Outgoing runner timing excellent - at maximum controllable speed by exchange without early departure. Verbal command perfectly timed and clear. Exchange occurs at optimal zone location (late in zone for 4x100m, mid-zone for 4x400m). Virtually never drops baton even under championship pressure. Non-visual exchanges perfectly blind with complete trust. Both runners maintain maximum speed through zone - no slowing visible. Excellent timing with all partners, quick adjustment to new teammates. Can demonstrate perfect technique and coach others. Exchanges gain time on competitors through superior execution - team's combined time faster than sum of individual times. Serves as model for relay exchanges. Competitive advantage in relay events through exceptional handoff quality."

      "label": "Elite",
      "description": "World-class relay handoff technique among the most efficient globally. Biomechanically perfect exchange execution - textbook technique serving as international model. Receiver's hand provides perfect stationary target, incoming runner hits it precisely every time. Outgoing runner timing perfection - at absolute maximum controllable speed by exchange. Verbal command precisely calibrated. Exchange occurs at mathematically optimal zone location. Zero drops or fumbles even in Olympic or World Championship finals under maximum pressure. Non-visual exchanges perfectly blind demonstrating complete trust and practice. Both runners at maximum speed through zone. Perfect timing with regular partners, can adapt to new teammates quickly. Exchanges gain significant time on competitors - team runs faster than individual times would suggest possible. Demonstrates championship-level execution during major finals. Among the best relay teams globally. Serves as international model for relay technique. Decisive competitive advantage through superior exchange quality enabling medals at highest level."

  "assessmentGuidance": "Observe during relay practice and competition. Watch receiver's hand: stationary versus moving, proper position (palm out, thumb down). Note outgoing runner's speed at exchange - should be at or near maximum. Listen for verbal command: timing, clarity, consistency. Measure or observe exchange location within 20m zone. Count drops, fumbles, and zone violations. Watch for visual checking in non-visual exchanges. Note speed maintenance - both runners should be at maximum through zone. Time full relay and compare to sum of individual best times (good exchanges result in relay time faster than sum). Video analysis helpful for detailed review. Assess partnership consistency - can they exchange successfully with regular partner? New partner? Note: This skill only applies to athletes competing in relay events. Requires regular practice with teammates to develop."
