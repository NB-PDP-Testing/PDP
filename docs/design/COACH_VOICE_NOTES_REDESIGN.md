# Coach Voice Notes View - Complete Redesign

**Date**: January 21, 2026
**Status**: DESIGN PROPOSAL
**Priority**: HIGH

---

## THE PROBLEM

Current implementation shows AI-processed insights, but coaches need:
1. **Clear view of their RAW voice notes** (their diary/journal)
2. **Separate view for parent communications** (what insights were generated, what parents received)

---

## PROPOSED SOLUTION: TWO-TAB SYSTEM

**Tab Order Logic:**
- **Tab 1 (Primary)**: Parent Communications - Active work (approvals, editing, tracking)
- **Tab 2 (Archive)**: My Voice Notes - Historical record (diary, reference)

This prioritizes the action-oriented workflow over historical review.

---

### Tab 1: "Parent Communications" (What Parents See) - PRIMARY TAB
**Purpose**: Manage what's shared with parents and track engagement

**Display Format**: Player-Organized View

**Why This is Tab 1**: This is where coaches spend most of their time - approving summaries, editing content, tracking what parents have seen. It's the "active work" tab.

```

### Tab 2: "My Voice Notes" (Coach's Diary) - ARCHIVE TAB
**Purpose**: Coach's personal record of observations

**Display Format**: Table/Timeline View

**Why This is Tab 2**: This is the historical archive - coaches refer back to old notes less frequently than they manage active parent communications.

```

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Buttons Navigate To**:
- "Manage Parent Communications" → Tab 1 (Parent Communications)
- "View All My Notes" → Tab 2 (My Voice Notes)

This keeps the passport clean and directs coaches to the proper management views.

This makes it CRYSTAL CLEAR what's private vs what gets shared.
