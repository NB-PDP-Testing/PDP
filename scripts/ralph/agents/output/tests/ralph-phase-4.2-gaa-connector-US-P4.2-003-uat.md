## Story
As the sync engine, I need to fetch detailed member information for individual members to get complete profile data.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Add to packages/backend/convex/actions/gaaFoireann.ts
- [ ] Implement fetchMemberDetail action with args: connectorId, memberId
- [ ] Create FederationApiClient instance
- [ ] Call GET /members/{memberId} endpoint
- [ ] Parse detailed response including: full address, emergency contacts, medical info, player positions, teams
- [ ] Return: { member: GAAMemberDetail, fetchedAt: number }
- [ ] Add caching: store fetched details in temporary cache (5 min TTL) to avoid duplicate API calls
- [ ] Handle errors: 404 (member not found), 403 (no access to member)
- [ ] TypeScript type: GAAMemberDetail extends GAAMember with additional fields
- [ ] Run npx ultracite fix and npm run check-types
