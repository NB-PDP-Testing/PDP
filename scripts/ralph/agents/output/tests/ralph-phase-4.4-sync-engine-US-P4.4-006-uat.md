## Story
As the platform, I need to receive webhook notifications from federations when member data changes so I can sync immediately instead of waiting for nightly batch.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Create packages/backend/convex/http.ts webhook endpoint: POST /webhooks/federation
- [ ] Endpoint expects: { connectorId, federationOrgId, memberId, event (created/updated/deleted), signature }
- [ ] Validate webhook signature using connector's webhookSecret (HMAC-SHA256)
- [ ] Reject requests with invalid signatures (401 Unauthorized)
- [ ] Parse event type: created, updated, deleted
- [ ] For created/updated: enqueue sync job for that specific member (not full sync)
- [ ] For deleted: mark player as inactive, don't delete (audit trail)
- [ ] Return 200 OK immediately (don't block webhook sender)
- [ ] Process webhook asynchronously using Convex action
- [ ] Log all webhook events for debugging
- [ ] Add rate limiting: max 100 webhooks per minute per connector
- [ ] Run npx ultracite fix and npm run check-types
