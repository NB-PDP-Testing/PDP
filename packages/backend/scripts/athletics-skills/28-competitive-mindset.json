  "description": "Psychological resilience to handle pressure, discomfort, and competition challenges. Dimensions include confidence, motivation, ability to focus, relaxation under pressure, and maintaining positive attitude. Athletes who reach podium can escape comfort zone and take calculated risks. Mental toughness directly related to concentration control - focusing on important cues and blocking distractions. Competitive mindset separates athletes who perform best when it matters from those who underperform under pressure.",

      "description": "Weak competitive mindset limiting performance under pressure. Lacks confidence in own abilities, doubts capacity to compete successfully. Motivation primarily external (pleasing others) rather than internal drive. Cannot focus under pressure - easily distracted by competitors, crowd, conditions, or negative thoughts. Tenses up dramatically in competitive situations, losing all relaxation and technique. Maintains negative attitude - focuses on what might go wrong rather than positive outcomes. Cannot escape comfort zone - plays it safe, avoids risks, never reaches for challenging goals. Gives up mentally when things get difficult - behind in race, feeling pain, or conditions unfavorable. Demonstrates fear of failure paralyzing performance. In important competitions, performs worse than training would predict. Cannot handle setbacks or adversity - one bad race leads to downward spiral. Shows no mental toughness when suffering - slows down immediately when discomfort begins. Avoids competitive situations when possible."

  "assessmentGuidance": "Assess through observation and discussion across multiple competitions and situations. Compare training performances to competition performances - consistently better in competition suggests strong mindset, worse suggests mental barriers. Observe body language and demeanor before, during, and after competitions - relaxed and confident versus tense and worried. Note responses to adversity: trailing in race, bad weather, strong competitors, setbacks. Discuss motivation: internal versus external, process versus outcome focused. Evaluate focus and concentration: can athlete maintain attention on performance cues or easily distracted? Observe risk-taking: plays it safe versus pursues challenging goals appropriately. Track resilience: how does athlete respond to poor performances, injuries, or failures? Use sport psychology assessments if available. Discuss mental skills use: does athlete employ visualization, self-talk, routines? Remember competitive mindset develops over time through positive competitive experiences and mental skills training - expect gradual improvement and occasional setbacks."
