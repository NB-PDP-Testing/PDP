> Auto-generated: 2026-01-28 13:58
> Status: ⏳ Pending Execution

## Story
As a user, I see onboarding steps presented one at a time in a coordinated flow, not multiple overlapping dialogs.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Create new file: apps/web/src/components/onboarding/onboarding-orchestrator.tsx
- [ ] Create OnboardingOrchestrator component that:
- [ ] - Uses useQuery to call getOnboardingTasks
- [ ] - Maintains state for currentStepIndex (starts at 0)
- [ ] - Renders children (rest of app) always
- [ ] - If tasks.length > 0, renders modal for current task
- [ ] Component structure:
- [ ] export function OnboardingOrchestrator({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
- [ ] const tasks = useQuery(api.models.onboarding.getOnboardingTasks);
- [ ] const [currentStepIndex, setCurrentStepIndex] = useState(0);
- [ ] const currentTask = tasks?.[currentStepIndex];
- [ ] const handleStepComplete = () => {
- [ ] setCurrentStepIndex(prev => prev + 1);
- [ ] };
- [ ] return (
- [ ] <>
- [ ] {children}
- [ ] {currentTask && (
- [ ] <OnboardingStepRenderer task={currentTask} onComplete={handleStepComplete} />
- [ ] )}
- [ ] </>
- [ ] );
- [ ] }
- [ ] Create placeholder OnboardingStepRenderer that just shows task.type in a modal
- [ ] Run: npm run check-types
