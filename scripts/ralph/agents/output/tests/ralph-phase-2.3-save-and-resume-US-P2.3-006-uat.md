## Story
As an admin resuming a draft, I need the wizard to restore my previous settings after I re-upload the CSV file.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] When wizard opens with draft data, start at upload step (step 0) regardless of saved step
- [ ] Show message: 'Please re-upload [filename] to continue where you left off'
- [ ] After file upload and parsing, verify headers match the saved draft headers
- [ ] If headers match: auto-apply saved mappings, selections, and settings — jump to saved step
- [ ] If headers don't match: show warning 'The uploaded file has different columns than the original. Your previous mappings may not apply.' Let user choose: apply anyway or start fresh
- [ ] If user chooses start fresh, delete the draft and proceed normally
- [ ] Run npx ultracite fix and npm run check-types
