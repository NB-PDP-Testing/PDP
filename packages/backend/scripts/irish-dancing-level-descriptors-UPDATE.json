              "level1Descriptor": "Dancer is developing awareness of the characteristic Irish dance upper body stillness, learning to keep arms at their sides while attempting footwork. Upper body frequently moves during execution of steps, with visible compensatory movements especially during complex sequences. Arms may swing, wiggle side-to-side, or lift away from the body involuntarily. Core engagement is developing but inconsistent, making it challenging to maintain the rigid, motionless torso that defines Irish dance style. Dancer requires constant reminders and coaching cues to maintain proper upper body positioning during practice and performance.",
              "level2Descriptor": "Dancer demonstrates reliable upper body control in practice settings and basic routines, with arms consistently held at sides during familiar step sequences. Upper body stillness is established during foundational movements, though occasional compensatory movements occur during more challenging choreography or when fatigued. Core strength has developed sufficiently to stabilize the torso during most movements, with visible improvement in ability to maintain characteristic stillness during jumps and turns. Dancer can self-correct when reminded and is beginning to recognize when upper body movement occurs. Adequate upper body control for grade examinations and beginner-level feis competitions.",
              "level3Descriptor": "Dancer maintains strong, autonomous upper body control at competition pace, with minimal compensatory movements even during complex choreography. Upper body remains quiet and motionless throughout routines at regional feis competitions, demonstrating consistent core engagement and muscle control. Arms stay straight at sides with good proximity to body, and stillness is maintained during rapid footwork, jumps, turns, and traveling steps. Dancer exhibits the characteristic Irish dance aesthetic of dramatic contrast between still torso and active lower body. Control is consistent in both soft shoe and hard shoe dances. This level of upper body stillness is competitive at Novice and Prizewinner levels in regional feiseanna.",
              "level4Descriptor": "Dancer exhibits excellent upper body control under competitive pressure at major feiseanna and championship levels. Upper body appears completely still throughout all routines, with no visible compensations even during the most challenging sequences, complex turns, high jumps, or rapid directional changes. Complete mastery of core control creates the signature Irish dance silhouette, with perfect stillness maintained from shoulders through torso. Arms remain effortlessly positioned at sides throughout preliminary championship choreography. Control is consistent across all dance types and tempos, maintained under fatigue, and demonstrates the professional standard expected at national-level competition. Upper body stillness becomes a technical strength that enhances overall performance quality.",
              "level5Descriptor": "Dancer demonstrates world-class upper body control that defines elite championship performance. Perfect upper body stillness is maintained effortlessly at all times, even during maximum difficulty choreography at World Championship and All Ireland Championship levels.

Chin level is inconsistent, sometimes lifted too high or dropped toward chest. Head position varies noticeably throughout routines, and dancer shows limited awareness of proper positioning without direct coaching reminders. Eyes wander downward when concentrating on footwork, breaking the forward gaze essential to Irish dance presentation. Neck alignment with spine is developing, and dancer struggles to maintain evenly balanced head position atop a relaxed neck while executing complex foot patterns. Requires constant reminders to keep eyes forward and chin level.",
