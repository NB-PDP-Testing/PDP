> Auto-generated: 2026-01-25 18:20
> Status: ⏳ Pending Execution

## Story
As the system, I detect and react to API degradation.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Create lib/circuitBreaker.ts
- [ ] Export function shouldCallAPI(serviceHealth): boolean
- [ ] If circuitBreakerState === 'open': return false (don't call API)
- [ ] If circuitBreakerState === 'half_open': allow 1 test call to check if service recovered
- [ ] If circuitBreakerState === 'closed': return true (normal operation)
- [ ] Export function recordAPIResult(success: boolean): updates failure counts, state transitions
- [ ] State transitions: closed → open (5 failures in 5 min), open → half_open (after 1 min cooldown), half_open → closed (success) or open (failure)
- [ ] Typecheck passes
