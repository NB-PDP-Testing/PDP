  "category": "Tactical & Mental",
  "description": "Internal sense of appropriate effort level and pace for event distance without relying on external feedback. Developed through training at specific intensities and race experience. Critical for middle and long distance events where pacing errors (too fast early, too slow overall) cost significant time. Athletes learn to associate perceived effort with actual pace. Technology (GPS watches, track markers) aids development but shouldn't replace internal awareness. Superior pacing judgment enables even-effort racing and optimal time performance.",

      "description": "No pacing judgment or internal sense of appropriate effort levels. Cannot estimate pace within 30+ seconds per mile without looking at watch or getting splits. Goes out far too fast in races (30+ seconds faster than sustainable pace) then dies dramatically, or too conservative and finishes with excessive energy remaining. Relies completely on external feedback (watch, splits, competitors) to regulate effort - lost without it. Cannot distinguish between different training paces by feel - easy and tempo feel the same effort-wise. No association between perceived effort and actual pace established. In workouts, each interval at random pace unless externally regulated. Demonstrates complete lack of pace awareness. Cannot execute \"run by feel\" instructions - needs constant external regulation. Shows no improvement in pacing across repeated races of same distance - makes same errors repeatedly. Has no sense whether current pace is sustainable for remaining distance."

      "label": "Emerging",
      "description": "Basic pacing judgment developing but still heavily reliant on external feedback. Can estimate pace within 15-20 seconds per mile sometimes but inconsistent. Still tends to go out too fast in races though less extreme (15-20 seconds too fast) or too conservative. Improving ability to distinguish between major training pace categories (easy versus tempo versus interval) by feel. Beginning to associate perceived effort with actual pace but connection weak and unreliable. In workouts, interval paces more consistent but still variable without external monitoring. Can execute \"run by feel\" instructions with moderate success but significant variation. Shows some learning across repeated races - pacing errors less severe than initially. Beginning to develop sense of sustainable effort for race distances. Responds to coaching about pacing but application inconsistent. Demonstrates awareness that pacing matters but limited internal regulation capability."

      "description": "Good pacing judgment with developing internal sense of appropriate efforts. Can estimate pace within 5-10 seconds per mile consistently in familiar conditions. Executes reasonable pacing in races - may go out slightly fast (5-10 seconds) but not disastrously. Can distinguish between all training pace categories by feel with good accuracy. Solid association between perceived effort and actual pace established through consistent training. In workouts, hits target paces reliably by feel without constant watch checking. Can execute \"run by feel\" instructions successfully in most situations. Shows learning across races - pacing improves with experience at each distance. Good sense of sustainable effort for race distances - rarely misjudges dramatically. Can adjust pacing based on conditions (heat, wind, hills) appropriately. Still uses external feedback as confirmation but not dependent on it. Demonstrates competent pace awareness appropriate for club-regional level. Makes minor pacing errors but nothing race-destroying."

      "label": "Advanced",
      "description": "Excellent pacing judgment with highly developed internal regulation. Can estimate pace within 3-5 seconds per mile in all conditions. Executes excellent race pacing - typically within 2-3 seconds of optimal splits. Distinguishes between all training paces precisely by feel - can hit any target pace without watch. Strong internal association between perceived effort and actual pace - calibrated through years of consistent training. In workouts, nails target paces by feel consistently - watch just confirms what already knows. Can execute any \"run by feel\" instruction perfectly. Demonstrates sophisticated pacing that improves performance - optimal even-effort distribution or appropriate tactical variations. Perfect sense of sustainable effort for all race distances. Adjusts pacing expertly for all conditions without needing to think consciously. Uses watch/splits as data points but doesn't need them for regulation. Competitive advantage through superior pacing - runs faster times than less calibrated athletes with similar physiology. Can teach pacing concepts to others. Serves as model for pacing discipline and judgment."

      "label": "Elite",
      "description": "World-class pacing judgment among the most precise globally. Can estimate pace within 1-2 seconds per mile at any speed. Executes perfect race pacing in Olympic and World Championship finals - optimal even-effort or precisely executed tactical variations. Internal effort-pace association perfectly calibrated through years of elite training. Hits any target pace precisely by feel regardless of conditions. Demonstrates championship-level pacing that maximizes performance - world records set with near-perfect even pacing (post-2008 trend). Perfect sense of sustainable effort enabling optimal performance across all distances. Adjusts pacing flawlessly for altitude, heat, wind, competition, rounds (heats to finals). Can race entirely by feel without any external feedback if necessary. Pacing judgment never fails even under extreme championship pressure or unusual conditions. Among the most precisely calibrated pace-effort associations globally. Serves as international model for pacing excellence. Competitive advantage through perfect pacing execution - never goes out too fast or leaves time on track through conservative pacing. No pacing errors observable across entire career at highest level."

  "assessmentGuidance": "Assess through multiple methods: During training, have athlete predict pace before checking watch, then compare actual to predicted. In workouts, observe how closely athlete hits target paces when running by feel without watch. During races, compare split times to optimal pacing - even splits generally optimal for time, measure deviation. Track pacing consistency across multiple races at same distance - improving judgment shows learning. Test with \"blind\" runs where athlete cannot see watch but must hit target pace. Discuss post-race: did athlete know they were on pace, too fast, or too slow? Evaluate in varying conditions: can athlete adjust pacing appropriately for heat, wind, hills without over-compensating? Note reliance on external feedback: watch constantly versus occasional checks versus no checking. Remember pacing judgment develops slowly through consistent training at specific paces and race experience - expect gradual improvement over months and years."
