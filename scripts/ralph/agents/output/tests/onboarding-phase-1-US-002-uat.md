## Story
As the system, I need to evaluate all pending onboarding tasks for a user and return them in priority order.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Create new file: packages/backend/convex/models/onboarding.ts
- [ ] Create query: getOnboardingTasks
- [ ] Args: none (uses authenticated user from ctx)
- [ ] Returns: v.array(v.object({ type: v.string(), priority: v.number(), data: v.any() }))
- [ ] Query logic - check in this order:
- [ ] 1. Check pending invitations: query invitation table where email = user.email AND status = 'pending'
- [ ] 2. Check pending child links: query guardianPlayerLinks where guardianIdentity.userId = user.id AND acknowledgedByParentAt = undefined
- [ ] 3. (Future: GDPR check will be added in Phase 2)
- [ ] Build task array with priority:
- [ ] - accept_invitation: priority 1
- [ ] - child_linking: priority 2
- [ ] - welcome: priority 3 (if first login to org)
- [ ] Return tasks sorted by priority ascending
- [ ] Run: npm run check-types
- [ ] Run: npx -w packages/backend convex codegen
