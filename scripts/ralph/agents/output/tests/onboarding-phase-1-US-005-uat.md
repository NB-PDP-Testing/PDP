> Auto-generated: 2026-01-28 14:01
> Status: ⏳ Pending Execution

## Story
As a parent with pending guardian claims, I see the claim prompt through the orchestrator instead of the old BulkClaimProvider.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Read: apps/web/src/components/bulk-claim-provider.tsx to understand current logic
- [ ] The key logic to migrate:
- [ ] - Query for claimable guardian identities (email match, no userId)
- [ ] - Query for pending child acknowledgements
- [ ] - Show BulkGuardianClaimDialog when claims exist
- [ ] Update getOnboardingTasks query to include guardian_claim task type:
- [ ] - Check guardianIdentities where email = user.email AND userId = undefined
- [ ] - If found, add task: { type: 'guardian_claim', priority: 1, data: { identities: [...] } }
- [ ] Update OnboardingOrchestrator to handle guardian_claim type:
- [ ] - When currentTask.type === 'guardian_claim', render BulkGuardianClaimDialog
- [ ] - Pass onComplete callback to dialog's onClaimComplete prop
- [ ] Import BulkGuardianClaimDialog in orchestrator
- [ ] Run: npm run check-types
- [ ] Test: User with pending guardian claim → Sees dialog through orchestrator
