  "description": "Execution of block start for sprints up to and including 400m. Proper technique includes optimal block spacing (medium spacing most common: front block 2 foot-lengths from line, rear block 3 foot-lengths), powerful set position with hips elevated above shoulders, explosive reaction to gun, aggressive first step backward and down into track, and progressive acceleration with controlled stride lengthening. Block starts allow maximum horizontal force production at race beginning.",

      "description": "Unfamiliar with starting blocks showing poor setup and execution. Block spacing random or copied without understanding individual biomechanics. Set position weak - hips too low or too high, weight distribution poor, body position unstable. Weak block clearance with inadequate force production - appears to step out of blocks rather than explode. Stands upright immediately after gun rather than maintaining drive position. First steps reaching forward (overstriding) instead of driving backward and down. Slow reaction time to gun with delayed processing. Frequent false starts due to poor gun anticipation or body control. Looks down at track immediately after start. Cannot maintain consistent technique across multiple start attempts. Demonstrates no understanding of proper block start mechanics or their importance for race performance."

      "label": "Emerging",
      "description": "Basic block start ability with setup and execution improving but not optimal. Block spacing adequate but may not be individualized - uses generic spacing without testing alternatives. Set position reasonable but inconsistent - hip height varies, weight distribution imperfect, some instability in hold. Moderate push from blocks but not explosive. Some forward lean maintained after gun but often rises too quickly (by 3-5 meters). First step improved but may still reach somewhat forward rather than optimal backward drive. Reaction time improving but not competitive at higher levels. Occasional false starts, particularly under pressure. Can implement coaching corrections during practice but struggles to maintain under competition stress. Shows improvement trajectory but needs considerable refinement."

      "label": "Competent",
      "description": "Good block start mechanics with consistent setup and execution. Block spacing individualized and tested for optimal configuration. Set position solid and consistent - hips elevated above shoulders (front knee 90-110 degrees, rear knee 120-140 degrees), weight properly distributed, body position stable and powerful. Powerful block clearance with strong push from both blocks simultaneously. Maintains appropriate forward lean through first 10+ meters. First step drives backward and down creating optimal acceleration. Reasonable reaction time (0.16-0.20 seconds) competitive at club-regional level. Rare false starts with good gun discipline. Can maintain technique under competition pressure. Demonstrates competent starts enabling strong race beginnings. Self-correcting if setup or execution degrades."

      "label": "Advanced",
      "description": "Excellent block start technique with optimal setup and explosive execution. Block spacing perfectly individualized through extensive testing and refinement. Set position optimal and rock-solid - perfect hip height, ideal weight distribution, maximum stability and coil. Explosive block clearance with maximum horizontal force production - can see blocks move from push force. First step perfectly executes backward and down drive. Maintains optimal forward lean throughout entire acceleration phase. Fast reaction time (0.13-0.16 seconds) creating competitive advantage. Virtually no false starts - perfect gun discipline. Technique holds under championship pressure. Can demonstrate perfect starts and explain biomechanics to others. Elite-level first 10 meters from blocks. Serves as model for starting technique."

      "label": "Elite",
      "description": "World-class starting ability demonstrating perfect technique and exceptional reaction. Block setup optimized through years of refinement for individual biomechanics. Set position biomechanically perfect - ideal angles, maximum coil, perfect stability. Exceptionally fast reaction time (0.11-0.14 seconds) among quickest globally while maintaining legal starts. Explosive block clearance generates maximum possible horizontal force - among most powerful starts in the world. First step and acceleration phase flawless. Maintains perfect technique during Olympic or World Championship finals under maximum pressure. Serves as international model for block start mechanics. Decisive competitive advantage through superior starting ability. No technical flaws observable. Gun discipline perfect despite racing on the edge of legal reaction time. Among the best starters globally."

  "assessmentGuidance": "Observe set position carefully: measure or estimate knee angles, hip height relative to shoulders, weight distribution (should be forward on hands). Watch gun reaction - measure reaction time if possible (time from gun to first movement). Observe block clearance force and direction. Note body angles during first 3-5 steps - should maintain forward lean. Video analysis essential for detailed evaluation - freeze frame set position, measure angles, review slow-motion clearance. Measure 10m split time from gun as indicator of start quality. Count and evaluate false starts. Assess consistency across multiple start attempts and under competitive pressure."
