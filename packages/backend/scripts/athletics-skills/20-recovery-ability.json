  "category": "Endurance & Physiological",
  "description": "Rate at which athlete recovers between efforts within training sessions, between training sessions across days, and between competitive efforts. Influences training volume capacity, adaptation rate, and competition readiness. Superior recovery enables higher quality and quantity of training. Affected by genetics, training status, nutrition, sleep quality and quantity, stress management, and recovery practices. Critical for athletes training at high levels where recovery becomes limiting factor for performance improvement.",

      "label": "Developing",
      "description": "Poor recovery ability limiting training capacity and adaptation. Requires very extended rest between interval repetitions - may need 5-10 minutes between moderate efforts. Cannot train on consecutive days without severe fatigue accumulation. Single hard session requires 3-5 days recovery before another quality workout possible. Soreness persists for many days after hard training. Heart rate recovery slow - takes 5+ minutes to return to near-baseline after hard effort. Sleep may be disrupted after hard training. No recovery practices employed (stretching, foam rolling, ice baths, compression, etc.). Nutrition and hydration habits poor. Training frequency limited to 2-3 sessions per week maximum due to inadequate recovery. Demonstrates fundamental limitation in recovery capacity restricting training load and adaptation potential. Chronic fatigue common if attempts to train more frequently or intensely."

      "label": "Emerging",
      "description": "Moderate recovery ability improving with training adaptation. Requires substantial rest between interval repetitions but improving - 3-5 minutes between efforts. Can train on consecutive days occasionally but requires frequent rest days to avoid excessive fatigue. Hard session requires 2-3 days before another quality workout possible. Soreness typical for 2-3 days after hard training but manageable. Heart rate recovery improving - returns to reasonable level within 3-5 minutes. Beginning to implement basic recovery practices inconsistently. Nutrition and hydration improving but not optimized. Can train 3-5 sessions per week with careful management. Shows improvement trajectory as training status develops. Demonstrates better recovery capacity than beginner but still limits training progression. Fatigue management requires attention and planning."

    "3": {
      "label": "Competent",
      "description": "Good recovery ability enabling consistent training at club level. Requires moderate rest between interval repetitions appropriate for intensity - 2-4 minutes typically sufficient. Can train on consecutive days regularly with appropriate load management. Hard session requires 1-2 days before another quality session, can do easy runs between. Soreness present but resolves within 24-48 hours typically. Heart rate recovery good - returns to near-baseline within 2-3 minutes after efforts. Implements recovery practices reasonably - stretches, rolls, adequate sleep most nights. Nutrition and hydration generally appropriate. Can train 5-7 sessions per week with proper periodization. Recovery capacity supports club-regional level training loads. Demonstrates appropriate balance between training stress and recovery. Rarely experiences overwhelming fatigue with sensible training progression. Can compete on consecutive days if needed with reasonable performance maintenance."

    "4": {
      "label": "Advanced",
      "description": "Excellent recovery ability enabling high training loads at regional-national level. Requires minimal rest between interval repetitions - ready for next effort within 1-3 minutes depending on intensity. Can train twice daily when appropriate with good quality in both sessions. Hard session requires only 1 day before another quality session, can do moderate training between. Soreness minimal and resolves quickly (within 24 hours typically). Heart rate recovery very quick - returns to near-baseline within 90-120 seconds. Implements comprehensive recovery practices consistently - quality sleep prioritized, nutrition optimized, stretching/rolling routine, other modalities as needed. Can train 7-12+ sessions per week (including doubles) with proper planning. Recovery capacity supports national-level training loads (80-100+ miles per week for distance runners). Demonstrates superior recovery enabling high training volumes and frequencies. Can compete multiple times per week if necessary with minimal performance decrement."

      "label": "Elite",
      "description": "World-class recovery ability enabling elite training loads at international level. Requires very minimal rest between interval repetitions - ready within 60-90 seconds even after hard efforts. Can train twice daily regularly with high quality throughout. Hard sessions can be performed frequently (potentially daily with appropriate planning) due to exceptional recovery capacity. Soreness minimal or absent even after very hard training. Heart rate recovery exceptionally quick - returns to near-baseline within 60 seconds. Implements comprehensive, sophisticated recovery program - sleep optimized (8-10 hours nightly), nutrition periodized for training, professional recovery modalities (massage, physiotherapy, etc.). Can train 10-14+ sessions per week consistently. Recovery capacity supports world-class training loads (100-140+ miles per week for elite distance runners, 11-14 sessions weekly). Demonstrates elite-level recovery enabling training volumes and intensities that would overtrain most athletes. Can compete in multiple rounds (heats, semifinals, finals) on consecutive days maintaining peak performance. Among the best globally at recovering from training and competition stress."

  "assessmentGuidance": "Assess through multiple indicators: Monitor rest requirements between interval repetitions during training sessions. Track ability to train on consecutive days and perform quality sessions - how many days needed between hard workouts? Note soreness duration and severity after hard training. Measure heart rate recovery after standardized hard efforts (should return toward baseline within 1-3 minutes). Evaluate sleep quality and quantity. Assess overall fatigue levels across training weeks. Track training frequency and volume athlete can maintain while continuing to adapt positively. Observe performance across multiple competitions in short timeframes. Consider lifestyle factors affecting recovery: nutrition quality, sleep habits, stress levels, recovery practices employed. Remember recovery is both physiological (cardiovascular, muscular, metabolic systems) and psychological (mental fatigue, motivation). Poor recovery may indicate overtraining, inadequate nutrition/sleep, or excessive life stress rather than just low physiological recovery capacity."
