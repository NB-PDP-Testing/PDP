  "description": "Execution of lead leg drive, trail leg action, and body position over hurdle. Goal is to minimize air time and maintain sprint rhythm - hurdles are elongated sprint strides, not jumps. Lead leg drives explosively with high knee and dorsiflexed foot, thigh parallel to ground at clearance. Trail leg action continuous with tight snap under body requiring excellent hip flexibility. Body leans forward slightly to keep center of mass low. Event-specific skill for hurdle races (100mH, 110mH, 400mH).",

      "description": "Learning basic hurdle clearance with significant technical flaws and fear. Jumps over hurdles rather than running over them - excessive air time and vertical displacement. Lead leg mechanics poor: insufficient knee drive, foot not dorsiflexed, thigh well below parallel. Trail leg slow and disconnected - pauses or stops, drags over hurdle, doesn't snap tightly under body. Body position upright or leaning back rather than forward lean. Lands far from hurdle wasting time and distance. Rhythm completely disrupted by hurdle clearance - slows significantly before hurdle, lands in poor position after. Cannot maintain consistent step pattern between hurdles. Fear evident - approaches hesitantly, crashes hurdles frequently. Requires constant coaching on all aspects of technique. Demonstrates no understanding of hurdles as running event versus jumping event. Cannot complete hurdle race without hitting multiple barriers."

      "description": "Basic hurdle clearance developing but multiple technical issues remain. Still shows some jumping quality rather than running over - moderate air time. Lead leg improved: some knee drive visible, beginning to dorsiflex foot, though thigh still below optimal height. Trail leg action improving but remains slow - some snap developing but doesn't clear hurdle tightly, may still pause slightly. Body position better with some forward lean attempted though inconsistent. Landing closer to hurdle but not optimal. Rhythm disrupted less severely - can maintain some speed approaching and departing hurdle. Beginning to establish step pattern between hurdles (3-step for short hurdles, 13-17 for 400mH) though not consistent. Fear reducing - approaches with more confidence, hits hurdles occasionally but improving. Responds to coaching cues but needs frequent reminders. Shows improvement trajectory but considerable development needed. Can complete hurdle race but slowly and with technical breakdowns."

      "label": "Competent",
      "description": "Good hurdle clearance technique enabling competent hurdle racing. Runs over hurdles with reasonable efficiency - limited air time and vertical displacement. Lead leg mechanics sound: good knee drive, foot actively dorsiflexed, thigh approaching or reaching parallel at clearance. Trail leg action effective: continuous movement, snaps under body reasonably tightly, clears hurdle efficiently. Body position good with appropriate forward lean maintaining low center of mass. Lands close to hurdle in good position for next stride. Maintains reasonable rhythm - doesn't slow dramatically, recovers sprint quickly after clearance. Consistent step pattern between hurdles (3-step between short hurdles, appropriate pattern for 400mH). Minimal fear - attacks hurdles confidently, rarely hits barriers. Can self-correct technical issues during races. Competitive at club-regional level in hurdle events. Demonstrates solid understanding of hurdle racing as sprinting event with obstacles."

      "label": "Advanced",
      "description": "Excellent hurdle clearance technique competitive at regional-national level. Efficiently runs over hurdles with minimal air time - appears to skim over top. Lead leg mechanics excellent: explosive knee drive, perfect dorsiflexion, thigh parallel or above at clearance. Trail leg action powerful and tight: continuous snap, clears very tightly under body, excellent hip flexibility evident. Body position optimal with perfect forward lean, center of mass stays low throughout clearance. Lands immediately off hurdle in ideal position. Rhythm maintained excellently - maintains sprint speed throughout hurdle clearance, seamless integration of clearance into sprinting. Perfect step pattern consistency between hurdles. Zero fear - attacks hurdles aggressively, virtually never hits barriers. Can demonstrate perfect technique and explain biomechanics to others. Competitive advantage through superior clearance efficiency. Minimal time lost to hurdle clearance versus flat sprinting. Serves as model for hurdle technique."

      "label": "Elite",
      "description": "World-class hurdle clearance technique among the most efficient globally. Perfectly runs over hurdles with absolute minimal air time - appears effortless and barely clearing. Lead leg mechanics flawless: maximum explosive knee drive, perfect foot positioning, thigh well above parallel demonstrating exceptional flexibility and power. Trail leg action perfection: instantaneous tight snap, clears in absolute minimal space, elite-level hip flexibility. Body position biomechanically perfect maintaining lowest possible center of mass. Lands in optimal position enabling immediate return to maximum sprint. Rhythm perfection - maintains world-class sprint speed throughout race, hurdle clearances seamlessly integrated into sprinting with imperceptible disruption. Demonstrates championship-level technique during Olympic or World Championship finals. Among the most efficient hurdlers globally. Competitive advantage decisive through superior technique enabling faster times than less efficient hurdlers with similar sprint speed. Serves as international technical model. No flaws observable under any circumstance including major championship finals."

  "assessmentGuidance": "Observe during hurdle training and racing. Watch lead leg: knee height, foot dorsiflexion, thigh angle at clearance. Observe trail leg: continuous versus pausing, tightness of snap, height over hurdle. Note body position: forward lean versus upright, center of mass height. Measure or observe landing distance from hurdle. Listen to rhythm - should be continuous, not stop-start. Count steps between hurdles for consistency. Note how much hurdling slows the athlete versus their flat sprint speed. Video analysis essential for detailed technical evaluation - slow motion reveals all elements. Compare hurdle race time to flat sprint time over same distance (differential indicates efficiency). Observe confidence level and barrier contacts. Note: This skill only applies to athletes competing in hurdle events."
