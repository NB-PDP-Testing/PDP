## Story
As a parent accepting an invitation with pre-linked children, I expect those children to be visible on my dashboard after acceptance.

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Edit packages/backend/convex/models/members.ts
- [ ] Find syncFunctionalRolesFromInvitation function
- [ ] Add console.log to trace invitation.metadata.suggestedPlayerLinks
- [ ] Verify suggestedPlayerLinks array is being read from invitation metadata
- [ ] For each suggested link, create guardianPlayerLink with:
- [ ] - guardianIdentityId: from the matched/created guardian identity
- [ ] - playerIdentityId: from suggestedPlayerLinks[].playerIdentityId
- [ ] - relationship: from suggestedPlayerLinks[].relationship
- [ ] - acknowledgedByParentAt: undefined (pending state)
- [ ] - status: 'pending'
- [ ] Ensure guardianIdentity is created/matched BEFORE creating links
- [ ] Run: npm run check-types
- [ ] Test: Create invitation with 2 children → Accept → Query guardianPlayerLinks → Verify 2 links exist
