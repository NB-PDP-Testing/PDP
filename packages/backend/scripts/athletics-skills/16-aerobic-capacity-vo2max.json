  "skillName": "Aerobic Capacity (VO2 Max)",
  "category": "Endurance & Physiological",
  "description": "Maximum rate at which the body can consume and utilize oxygen during maximal exercise, measured in ml/kg/min. Represents the ceiling for aerobic performance - higher VO2 max enables higher sustainable work rates. Determined by cardiac output, oxygen-carrying capacity of blood, capillary density, mitochondrial function, and muscle fiber type. Important for all events 800m and longer, with increasing importance as race distance increases. Elite male distance runners: 70-85 ml/kg/min; elite females: 65-75 ml/kg/min.",

      "description": "Limited aerobic capacity appropriate for untrained state or early-stage youth athlete. Adult beginner typically below 40 ml/kg/min (men) or 35 ml/kg/min (women). Youth athlete showing age-appropriate developing capacity but minimal training adaptation. Becomes breathless quickly during sustained efforts. Cannot maintain even moderate paces for extended durations. Recovery prolonged between efforts due to limited oxygen delivery and utilization capacity. Demonstrates significant potential for improvement with consistent aerobic training. Performance in middle-distance and distance events severely limited by low aerobic ceiling. May struggle to complete even 800m at anything beyond slow pace. Cardiovascular system untrained with limited oxygen transport and utilization capacity."

      "description": "Improving aerobic capacity showing training response. Adult recreational runner: 40-50 ml/kg/min (men), 35-45 ml/kg/min (women). Youth athlete showing improvement with consistent training. Can sustain moderate efforts for reasonable durations (15-30 minutes) though pace remains submaximal. Recovery between interval efforts improving but still requires substantial rest. Cardiovascular adaptations beginning - stroke volume increasing, capillary density improving, mitochondrial function developing. Performance in endurance events limited but improving steadily. Can complete 800m-1500m at moderate competitive pace. Demonstrates clear improvement trajectory with regular aerobic training. Still has considerable ceiling for improvement with continued training progression."

      "label": "Competent",
      "description": "Good aerobic capacity for trained club-level athlete. Adult: 50-60 ml/kg/min (men), 45-55 ml/kg/min (women). Youth: above-average for age group with consistent training background. Can sustain high-moderate efforts for extended durations (30-60+ minutes). Recovery between hard efforts reasonable, can complete challenging interval sessions. Cardiovascular system well-adapted - good cardiac output, adequate oxygen carrying capacity, reasonable capillary and mitochondrial density. Competitive at local-regional level in middle-distance and distance events. Can race 800m through 10,000m competently at club level. Demonstrates solid training response and consistent performance. Further improvement possible but requires advanced training methods and greater volume."

      "description": "Excellent aerobic capacity approaching elite levels. Adult: 60-70 ml/kg/min (men), 55-65 ml/kg/min (women). Youth: exceptional for age, high-level junior competitor. Multi-year consistent training background evident. Can sustain hard efforts for extended durations with excellent work capacity. Recovery between high-intensity efforts quick, enabling demanding training loads. Cardiovascular system highly developed - large stroke volume, high oxygen carrying capacity, extensive capillary networks, high mitochondrial density. Competitive at regional-national level in endurance events. Demonstrates national-level competitor potential or achievement. Training capacity high - can handle substantial training volumes and intensities. Aerobic ceiling high enough to support elite-level performance with continued development."

      "label": "Elite",
      "description": "World-class aerobic capacity at international competition level. Adult: 70-85+ ml/kg/min (men), 65-75+ ml/kg/min (women). Youth: elite junior with international potential. Cardiovascular system maximally developed - exceptional cardiac output, optimal oxygen carrying capacity, extensive capillary networks, maximal mitochondrial density and function. Can sustain very high work rates for extended durations. Recovery ability exceptional, enabling world-class training loads. Competitive at Olympic or World Championship level in endurance events. Among highest VO2 max values globally for endurance athletes. Enables elite performance in events from 800m through marathon depending on other physiological factors (lactate threshold, running economy). Represents genetic potential combined with optimal long-term training. Aerobic ceiling among the highest in the world."

  "assessmentGuidance": "True VO2 max requires laboratory testing with gas analysis during graded exercise test to exhaustion (gold standard). Field estimates possible through Cooper 12-minute test, 1.5-mile run time, or predictive equations from race performance, though less accurate. Observe performance in sustained hard efforts - ability to maintain high paces, recovery speed between intervals, and overall endurance capacity provide indirect indicators. Note training history (years of consistent aerobic training strongly correlates with VO2 max development). Consider age and gender when interpreting values. Remember VO2 max is important but not sole determinant of endurance performance - lactate threshold and running economy equally or more important for predicting race performance."
