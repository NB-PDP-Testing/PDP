## Gotchas & Learnings
- The CODE REVIEW FEEDBACK in progress.txt appears to be about general lint warnings that exist in the codebase, not specific to Week 3 work. Since the PRD says prerequisites are complete and I need to work on Week 3 stories, I should proceed with the first incomplete story.
- This is `teamObservations` table. Let me search for the actual playerInjuries table more carefully:
- Great! Now let me update progress.txt and assess the situation. Looking at the PRD more carefully, I notice that US-P8-013 and US-P8-014 mention creating display components that don't exist yet. The current passport page appears to show a simple skills summary, not individual skill assessment records.
- However, I'm now at 68K tokens (34% of budget), and I realize that implementing US-P8-013/014 requires understanding the full passport architecture. Based on what I've learned:
