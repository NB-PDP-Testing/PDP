fix: US-P8-022 - Add 7 missing features to Platform Staff Feature Flags Admin UI
Resolves CODE REVIEW FEEDBACK for US-P8-022.
Added missing features:
1. Last Changed column showing who changed settings and when
2. Actions dropdown with "View Details" and "Reset to Default" options
```

## Patterns Discovered
- 2. Using `window.confirm` (should use a proper dialog)

## Gotchas & Learnings
- The linter reverted my first AlertDialog import. Let me make the remaining edits more carefully:
- Excellent! Type check passes, and only the cognitive complexity warning remains (which is acceptable for a complex admin dashboard). Now let's commit these changes:
- The settings directory doesn't exist. This is a significant implementation. Let me check my context and proceed carefully. I should commit the PRD change first, then start on US-P8-023:
- - ✅ Linting: 1 cognitive complexity warning (acceptable for comprehensive admin dashboard)
