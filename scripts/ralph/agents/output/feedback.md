### Generated: 2026-02-25

### Summary

| Story | Title | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| US-P2-001 | Guardian Sees Graduation Alert | PARTIAL (filter() violations, no email pre-fill) |
| US-P2-002 | Guardian Sends Account Invite Email | PARTIAL (no pre-fill, resend broken) |
| US-P2-003 | Player Claims Account via Token | PARTIAL (session.user.id bug) |
| US-P2-004 | Admin Manual Graduation Trigger | PARTIAL (admin invite blocked by guardian check) |
| US-P2-UAT | Phase 2 E2E Tests | PARTIAL (valid/expired/used token not covered) |

**Overall: PARTIAL — 3 CRITICAL bugs found**

---

### CRITICAL BUG 1: `session.user.id` instead of `session.user._id`

File: `apps/web/src/components/graduation/claim-wizard.tsx:215`

```typescript
userId: session.user.id,  // WRONG — must be session.user._id per CLAUDE.md
```

Impact: `claimPlayerAccount` will link the player identity to the wrong user ID. The claim appears to succeed but the player cannot access their account. This is the most severe bug in the phase.

---

### CRITICAL BUG 2: Admin `sendGraduationInvite` silently fails for non-guardian admins

File: `packages/backend/convex/models/playerGraduations.ts:160-181` and `apps/web/src/app/orgs/[orgId]/admin/players/[playerId]/edit/components/graduation-section.tsx:91-93`

`sendGraduationInvite` requires the caller to have a `guardianIdentities` record AND a `guardianPlayerLinks` record for the player. An admin who is not a guardian of the player will always receive "User is not a guardian". The admin Graduation Section calls this same mutation. The PRD explicitly states admin use "bypasses guardian" but no bypass exists. Admin invite flow is completely broken.

---

### CRITICAL BUG 3: Token resend does not invalidate previous tokens; resend blocked after first invite

File: `packages/backend/convex/models/playerGraduations.ts:184-194`

`sendGraduationInvite` only matches graduation records with status `"pending"`. After the first invite is sent, status becomes `"invitation_sent"` — any subsequent resend attempt returns `"No pending graduation record found"`. Old tokens are also never invalidated. PRD requires: "new token created, previous token invalidated." Neither condition is met for resends.

### US-P2-002 Results

| # | AC | Status | Evidence |
|---|-----|--------|---------|
| 1 | 'Send Account Invite' opens dialog | PASS | `graduation-alert.tsx:153,172` |
| 2 | Dialog pre-fills player email | FAIL | `graduation-alert.tsx:192` starts `useState("")`. `getPendingGraduations` does not return playerEmail. Email field always blank. |
| 3 | Dialog shows player name and explanation | PASS | `graduation-alert.tsx:236-242` |
| 4 | On confirm: calls `sendGraduationInvite` | PASS | `graduation-alert.tsx:205-208` |
| 5 | Complete TODO at playerGraduations.ts:217 | PASS | `playerGraduations.ts:232-241` — `ctx.scheduler.runAfter(0, ...)` implemented |
| 6 | `sendGraduationInvitationEmail()` added to email.ts | PASS | `email.ts:1447` |
| 7 | Email template complete (name, org, CTA, 30-day, branding) | PASS | `email.ts:1454-1525` |

| 10 | Resend: new token, previous invalidated | FAIL | See CRITICAL BUG 3 above. Resend blocked after first send; old tokens not invalidated. |
| 11 | check-types and codegen pass | NOT VERIFIED | |

---

### US-P2-003 Results

Note: Implementation uses `/claim-account/[token]` (path segment) rather than `/claim-account?token=xxx` (query param) as specified. Functionally equivalent; token preserved through auth redirects via path.

| # | AC | Status | Evidence |
|---|-----|--------|---------|
| 1 | Public route `claim-account/page.tsx` with token param | PASS | `app/claim-account/[token]/page.tsx` exists, no org auth |
| 2 | Calls `getPlayerClaimStatus(token)` | PASS | `page.tsx:35-40` |
| 3 | Valid token: player name, org, confirmation UI | PASS | `claim-wizard.tsx:249-253` |
| 4 | Invalid token: error with "contact guardian" | PARTIAL | Shows "Invalid Invitation" but missing "Contact your guardian for a new invite" text |
| 5 | Expired token: "expired" with "ask guardian to resend" | PASS | `page.tsx:73-85` |
| 6 | Used token: "already claimed, try signing in" | PASS | `page.tsx:62-72` |
| 7 | Not logged in: sign-in prompt; token preserved in redirect | PASS | `claim-wizard.tsx:291-302` — `/login?redirect=/claim-account/${token}` |
| 8 | Logged in + valid: confirmation before claiming | PASS | Multi-step wizard; explicit "Claim Account" button at confirm step |
| 9 | `sendClaimVerificationPin` mutation exists | PASS | `playerGraduations.ts:770-857` |
| 10 | PIN entry screen with masked destination, 6-digit input | PASS | `claim-wizard.tsx:308-380` |
| 11 | Wrong PIN shows error + remaining attempts; 3 = lock | PASS | `playerGraduations.ts:920-949`, `claim-wizard.tsx:144-154` |
| 12 | `verificationPins` schema table | PASS | `schema.ts:352-359` |
| 13 | `claimPlayerAccount` refuses without valid PIN | PASS | `playerGraduations.ts:505-521` |
| 14 | `claimPlayerAccount(token, userId)` called with correct userId | FAIL | CRITICAL BUG 1: `session.user.id` not `session.user._id` (`claim-wizard.tsx:215`) |
| 15 | After claim: redirect to `/orgs/[orgId]` | PASS | `claim-wizard.tsx:222-224` |
| 16 | `player-graduation-step.tsx` created and wired | PASS | Component exists; wired as `player_claimed_account` task type at `onboarding-orchestrator.tsx:298-308` |
| 17 | `age_transition_claimed` notification sent to admins | PASS | `notifications.ts:28`, `playerGraduations.ts:539-569` |

---

### US-P2-004 Results

| # | AC | Status | Evidence |
|---|-----|--------|---------|
| 1 | Graduation section in `/admin/players/[playerId]` for 18+ youth | PASS | `edit/page.tsx:508-517` — conditional on `playerType === "youth"` AND age >= 18 |
| 2 | Create page if not exists | PASS | Page exists at `edit/page.tsx` |
| 3 | Shows graduation status reactively | PASS | `graduation-section.tsx:87-90` — reactive `useQuery` |
| 4 | Admin 'Send Invitation' bypasses guardian | FAIL | CRITICAL BUG 2: `sendGraduationInvite` requires guardian link. Silently fails for admins. |
| 5 | 'Transition Now' calls `transitionToAdult` | PASS | `graduation-section.tsx:94-96,123-143` |
| 6 | Confirmation dialog with exact warning text | PASS | `graduation-section.tsx:275-320` — "cannot be undone", guardian contacts → emergency contacts |
| 7 | Real-time status updates | PASS | Convex reactive query |

---

---

### Warnings

1. `.filter()` used in `getPendingGraduations` (lines 59-64, 95) and `sendGraduationInvite` (line 189) after `.withIndex()`. Violates project ban on `.filter()`. Needs `by_player_and_status` index on `playerGraduations` table.

2. JSDoc comment at `playerGraduations.ts:136` still says "// TODO: Send email via action" — implementation is complete at line 232 but the comment was not cleaned up.

3. N+1 pattern in `getPendingGraduations`: loops over guardian links → per-player graduation query → per-graduation org query. In large orgs this hits Convex limits.

4. `getPlayerDashboard` and `hasPlayerDashboard` at `playerGraduations.ts:591+` use `.filter()` for organizationId within indexed queries.

---

### Required Fixes Before Acceptance

1. **CRITICAL** — `claim-wizard.tsx:215`: Change `session.user.id` to `session.user._id`
2. **CRITICAL** — Create `adminSendGraduationInvite` mutation (or add role-based bypass to `sendGraduationInvite`) that skips guardian checks when caller has admin/owner role in the organization
3. **CRITICAL** — Fix `sendGraduationInvite` to: (a) also accept `"invitation_sent"` status for resends, and (b) invalidate existing unused `playerClaimTokens` for the same player before inserting new token
4. **MINOR** — Remove "TODO: Send email via action" comment from `playerGraduations.ts:136`
5. **MINOR** — Pre-fill invite dialog email: add `playerEmail` field to `getPendingGraduations` return type; set in `SendInviteDialog` initial state

## PRD Audit - US-P2-UAT - 2026-02-25 17:40:01
**PARTIAL**

Test file exists at the correct path. Here's the breakdown:

**Passing criteria:**
- Test file created: `apps/web/uat/tests/player-graduation-phase2.spec.ts` ✅
- Invalid token error state: PG2-008 ✅
- Already-used token error state: PG2-010 (broadly — accepts invalid/already-claimed/expired/not-valid) ✅ (partial)
- Manual test checklist (tests 1-11): All documented in comments at bottom of file ✅

**Missing/inadequate criteria:**

1. **"dismiss button removes graduation alert"** — PG2-004 only checks the button is `toBeEnabled()`. It does NOT click the button and verify the alert disappears. AC says dismiss removes the alert.

2. **"VALID_TOKEN shows player name and org name"** — No test with a real/seeded valid token. PG2-012 only navigates to a non-existent token and accepts either wizard or error state.

3. **"EXPIRED_TOKEN shows expired error state"** — No dedicated test. PG2-010 bundles expired into a generic error check for a "used" token.

4. **"after successful claim, onboarding shows player_graduation step"** — No test exists.

5. **"claim flow shows PIN entry screen after login and token validation"** — No test exists.

6. **"entering wrong PIN shows error with remaining attempt count"** — No test exists.

7. **"entering correct PIN proceeds to claimPlayerAccount"** — No test exists.

8. **"wrong PIN 3 times shows lock message and does not call claimPlayerAccount"** — No test exists.

**Summary:** All 4 PIN-flow tests (criteria 9–12) and the valid token + post-claim onboarding tests (criteria 4, 8) are completely absent. The dismiss button test (criterion 3) is implemented incorrectly — it checks enabledness but not removal. ~8 of 12 automated test criteria are missing or inadequate.

## Code Review Gate - 2026-02-25 17:59:37

🔍 **Deep Code Review:** VERDICT: WARN

ISSUES:

- **[HIGH]** `playerGraduations.ts:57-65` — `getPendingGraduations`: Uses `.filter()` on `guardianPlayerLinks` after `.withIndex()` to filter by `status`. This post-index filter runs in-memory on all results. Needs a composite index `by_guardian_and_status` or filter status in application logic after collecting a bounded set.

- **[HIGH]** `playerGraduations.ts:82-124` — `getPendingGraduations`: Sequential N+1 pattern — `for...of` loop does `ctx.db.get()` per link and `ctx.db.query().withIndex()` per player, plus a `ctx.runQuery()` per graduation. With many linked children this is O(n) sequential DB calls. Should batch: collect all `playerIdentityId`s → `Promise.all(links.map(l => ctx.db.get(...)))`, then collect all graduation IDs → `Promise.all(...)`.

- **[HIGH]** `playerGraduations.ts:795-809` — `getPlayerDashboard`: N+1 query — `for...of` over `teamAssignments` doing one `ctx.runQuery(betterAuth.adapter.findOne)` per team. Batch team lookups via `findMany` with an `in` filter instead.

- **[MEDIUM]** `playerGraduations.ts:260-263` — `sendGraduationInvite`: `console.log` in production mutation.

- **[MEDIUM]** `playerGraduations.ts:690-692` — `claimPlayerAccount`: `console.log` in production mutation.

- **[MEDIUM]** `playerGraduations.ts:1012-1015` — `verifyClaimPin`: In-memory `.filter()` and `.sort()` on collected pins. The set is small (PINs per player) so low practical risk, but ideally use `.withIndex("by_player").order("desc").first()` filtering `usedAt` undefined.

- **[MEDIUM]** `playerGraduations.ts:761-767` / `864-869` — `getPlayerDashboard` / `hasPlayerDashboard`: Both use `.filter()` on `organizationId` after a `by_playerIdentityId` index. These need a composite index `by_playerIdentityId_and_organizationId` to avoid in-memory filtering.

- **[LOW]** `graduation-section.tsx:79` — `organizationId` prop is prefixed with `_` (`_organizationId`) indicating it's unused. The component takes it as a prop but never passes it to any query or mutation. The `sendAdminGraduationInvite` mutation fetches org details internally, but if the caller needs org-scoped authorization this should be wired through.

- **[INFO]** `graduation-section.tsx`: No auth/role check at the UI level — relies entirely on the backend mutations to enforce admin-only access, which is fine by pattern, but worth confirming `sendAdminGraduationInvite` is only accessible from admin routes.

## PRD Audit - US-P3-003 - 2026-02-25 19:28:32
**PARTIAL** — US-P3-003 is substantially implemented (~85%) but has a key gap.

**What's implemented correctly:**
- Extends existing import flow at `player-import/page.tsx` — no new pipeline created
- "Youth Match" column appears only for adult rows (age >= 18 check at line 997)
- Confidence badges: High (red `bg-red-100`), Medium (yellow `bg-yellow-100`), `-` for no match (lines 1046-1057)
- Per-row dropdown with "Accept Match", "Skip (New)", "Review Later" options (lines 1058-1080)
- Default selections: HIGH → "accept", MEDIUM → "skip" (lines 485-489)
- Import executes via existing `batchImportMutation` — "accept" rows go through `transitionToAdult` + enroll, all others through normal flow (lines 606-818)
- Youth rows and no-match adults proceed unchanged
- Import summary shows merged vs. new profile counts (lines 1092-1120)

**What's missing:**

1. **"Review Later" does not add a note to the profile.** The acceptance criteria states: *"creates new + adds a note to the profile"*. The UI option exists and the type is defined (`RowDecision = "accept" | "skip" | "review_later"`), but the execution handler (lines 606-818) treats `review_later` identically to `skip` — it creates a new profile but **no note is stored**. There is no notes field in `playerIdentities` schema and no backend logic to record the review intent.

2. **Import summary doesn't distinguish "skip" from "review_later"** — minor gap, conflates both as "new profiles."

**Type check:** Pre-existing failure in `diagnoseSafeGetAuthUser.ts` unrelated to this feature; no new type errors introduced.
